Metabolomics (i.e., the profiling and quantification of metabolites) is a relatively new field of “omics” studies. Different from other omics studies, metabolomics always focused on small molecular (molecular weight below 1500 Da) with much lower mass than polypeptide with single or doubled charged ions. Here is a demo of the position of metabolomics in “omics” studies[@b.dunn2011]. Figure 1.1: The complex interactions of functional levels in biological systems. Metabolomics studies always employ GC-MS(Theodoridis et al. 2012; Beale et al. 2018), GC*GC-MS(Tian et al. 2016), LC-MS(Gika et al. 2014), LC-MS/MS(Begou et al. 2017), IM-MS(Levy et al. 2019), infrared ion spectroscopy(Martens et al. 2017) or NMR[@b.dunn2011] to measure metabolites. For analytical methods, this review could be checked(Zhang et al. 2012). The overall technique progress of metabolomics (2012-2018) could be found here(Miggiels et al. 2019). However, this workflow will only cover mass spectrometry based metabolomics or XC-MS based research. 1.1 History 1.1.1 History of Mass Spectrometry Here is a historical commentary for mass spectrometry(Yates Iii 2011). In details, here is a summary: 1913, Sir Joseph John Thomson “Rays of Positive Electricity and Their Application to Chemical Analyses.” Figure 1.2: Sir Joseph John Thomson “Rays of Positive Electricity and Their Application to Chemical Analyses.” Petroleum industry bring mass spectrometry from physics to chemistry The first commercial mass spectrometer is from Consolidated Engineering Corp to analysis simple gas mixtures from petroleum In World War II, U.S. use mass spectrometer to separate and enrich isotopes of uranium in Manhattan Project U.S. also use mass spectrometer for organic compounds during wartime and extend the application of mass spectrometer 1946, TOF, William E. Stephens 1970s, quadrupole mass analyzer 1970s, R. Graham Cooks developed mass-analyzed ion kinetic energy spectrometry, or MIKES to make MRM analysis for multi-stage mass sepctrometry 1980s, MALDI rescue TOF and mass spectrometry move into biological application 1990s, Orbitrap mass spectrometry 2010s, Aperture Coding mass spectrometry 1.1.2 History of Metabolomcis You could check this report(Baker 2011). According to this book section(Kusonmano, Vongsangnak, and Chumnanpuen 2016): Figure 1.3: Metabolomics timeline during pre- and post-metabolomics era 2000-1500 BC some traditional Chinese doctors who began to evaluate the glucose level in urine of diabetic patients using ants 300 BC ancient Egypt and Greece that traditionally determine the urine taste to diagnose human diseases 1913 Joseph John Thomson and Francis William Aston mass spectrometry 1946 Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell Nuclear magnetic resonance late 1960s chromatographic separation technique 1971 Pauling’s research team “Quantitative Analysis of Urine Vapor and Breath by Gas–Liquid Partition Chromatography” Willmitzer and his research team pioneer group in metabolomics which suggested the promotion of the metabolomics field and its potential applications from agriculture to medicine and other related areas in the biological sciences 2007 Human Metabolome Project consists of databases of approximately 2500 metabolites, 1200 drugs, and 3500 food components post-metabolomics era high-throughput analytical techniques 1.1.3 Defination Metabolomics is actually a comprehensive analysis with identification and quantification of both known and unknown compounds in an unbiased way. Metabolic fingerprinting is working on fast classification of samples based on metabolite data without quantifying or identification of the metabolites. Metabolite profiling always need a pre-defined metabolites list to be quantification(Madsen, Lundstedt, and Trygg 2010). Meanwhile, targeted and untargeted metabolomics are also used in publications. For targeted metabolomics, the majority of the molecules within a biological pathway or a defined group of related metabolites are determined. Sometimes broad collection of known metabolites could also be referred as targeted analysis. Untargeted analysis detect all of possible metabolites unbiased in the samples of interest. A similar concept called non-targeted analysis/screen is actually describe the similar studies or workflow. 1.2 Reviews and tutorials Some nice reviews and tutorials related to this workflow could be found in those papers or directly online: 1.2.1 Workflow Those papers are recommended(González-Riano et al. 2020; Pezzatti et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2019; Barnes et al. 2016a; Cajka and Fiehn 2016; Gika et al. 2014; Theodoridis et al. 2012; X.
