Metabolomics (i.e., the profiling and quantitation of metabolites) is a relatively new field of “omics” studies. Different from other omics studies, metabolomics always focused on small molecular (molecular weight below 1500 Da) with much lower mass than polypeptide with single or doubled charged ions. Here is a demo of the position of metabolomics in “omics” studies(B. Dunn et al. 2011). Figure 1.1: The complex interactions of functional levels in biological systems. Metabolomics studies always employ GC-MS(Theodoridis et al. 2012; Beale et al. 2018), GC*GC-MS(Tian et al. 2016), LC-MS(Gika et al. 2014), LC-MS/MS(Begou et al. 2017a), IM-MS(Levy et al. 2019) or NMR(B. Dunn et al. 2011) to measure metabolites. However, this workflow will only cover mass spectrometry based metabolomics or XC-MS based research. 1.1 History 1.1.1 History of Mass Spectrometry 1913, Sir Joseph John Thomson “Rays of Positive Electricity and Their Application to Chemical Analyses.” Figure 1.2: Sir Joseph John Thomson “Rays of Positive Electricity and Their Application to Chemical Analyses.” Petroleum industry bring mass spectrometry from physics to chemistry The first commercial mass spectrometer is from Consolidated Engineering Corp to analysis simple gas mixtures from petroleum In World War II, U.S. use mass spectrometer to separate and enrich isotopes of uranium in Manhattan Project U.S. also use mass spectrometer for organic compounds during wartime and extend the application of mass spectrometer 1946, TOF, William E.

Metabolic fingerprinting is working on fast classification of samples based on metabolite data without quantifying or identification of the metabolites. Metabolite profiling always need a pre-defined metabolites list to be quantification(Madsen, Lundstedt, and Trygg 2010a). Meanwhile, targeted and untargeted metabolomics are also used in publicaitons. For targeted metabolomics, the majority of the molecules within a biosynthetic pathway or a defined group of related metabolites are determined. Sometimes broad collection of known metabolites could also be referred as targeted analysis. Untargeted analysis detect all of possible metabolites unbiased in the samples of interest. A similar concept called non-targeted analysis/screen is actually describe the similar studies or workflow. 1.2 Reviews and tutorials Some nice reviews and tutorials related to this workflow could be found in those papers or directly online: 1.2.1 Workflow Those papers are recommended(González-Riano et al. 2020; Pezzatti et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2019; Barnes et al. 2016a; Cajka and Fiehn 2016; Gika et al. 2014; Theodoridis et al. 2012; X.

Depending on different research purposes, experimental design can be classified into homogeneity and heterogeneity study. Technique such as isotope labeled media will not be discussed in this chapter while this paper(Jang, Chen, and Rabinowitz 2018) could be a good start. 2.1 Homogeneity study In homogeneity study, the research purpose is about method validation in most cases. Pooled sample made from multiple samples or technical replicates from same population will be used. Variances within the samples should be attributed to factors other than the samples themselves. For example, we want to know if sample injection order will affect the intensities of the unknown peaks, one pooled sample or technical replicates samples should be used. Another experimental design for homogeneity study will use biological replicates to find the common features from a group of samples. Biological replicates mean samples from same population with same biological process. For example, we wanted to know metabolites profiles of a certain species and we could collected lots of the individual samples from the population. Then only the peaks/compounds appeared in all samples will be used to describe the metabolites profiles of this species. Technical replicates could also be used with biological replicates. 2.2 Heterogeneity study In heterogeneity study, the research purpose is to find the differences among samples. You need at least a baseline to perform the comparison. Such baseline could be generated by random process, control samples or background knowledge. For example, outlier detection can be performed to find abnormal samples in unsupervised manners. Distribution or spatial analysis could be used to find geological relationship of known and unknown compounds. Temporal trend of metabolites profile could be found by time series or cohort studies. Clinical trial or random control trial is also an important class of heterogeneity studies. In this cases, you need at least two groups: treated group and control group. Also you could treat this group information as the one primary variable or primary variables to be explored for certain research purposes. In the following discussion about experimental design, we will use random control trail as model to discuss important issues. 2.3 Power analysis Supposing we have control and treated groups, the numbers of samples in each group should be carefully calculated.For each metabolite, such comparison could be treated as one t-test. You need to perform a Power analysis to get the numbers. For example, we have two groups of samples with 10 samples in each group. Then we set the power at 0.9, which means one minus Type II error probability, the standard deviation at 1 and the significance level (Type 1 error probability) at 0.05. Then we will get the meaningful delta between the two groups should be higher than 1.53367 under this experiment design. Also we could set the delta to get the minimized numbers of the samples in each group. To get those data such as the standard deviation or delta for power analysis, you need to perform preliminary or pilot experiments. power.t.test(n=10,sd=1,sig.level = 0.05,power = 0.9) ## ## Two-sample t test power calculation ## ## n = 10 ## delta = 1.53367 ## sd = 1 ## sig.level = 0.05 ## power = 0.9 ## alternative = two.sided ## ## NOTE: n is number in *each* group power.t.test(delta = 5,sd=1,sig.level = 0.05,power = 0.9) ## ## Two-sample t test power calculation ## ## n = 2.328877 ## delta = 5 ## sd = 1 ## sig.level = 0.05 ## power = 0.9 ## alternative = two.sided ## ## NOTE: n is number in *each* group However, since sometimes we could not perform preliminary experiment, we could directly compute the power based on false discovery rate control. If the power is lower than certain value, say 0.8, we just exclude this peak as significant features. In this review (Oberg and Vitek 2009), author suggest to estimate an average \\(\\alpha\\) according to this equation (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) and then use normal way to calculate the sample numbers: \\[ \\alpha_{ave} \\leq (1-\\beta_{ave})\\cdot q\\frac{1}{1+(1-q)\\cdot m_0/m_1} \\] Other study (Blaise et al. 2016) show a method based on simulation to estimate the sample size. They used BY correction to limit the influences from correlations. Other investigation could be found here(Saccenti and Timmerman 2016; Blaise 2013). However, the nature of omics study make the power analysis hard to use one number for all metabolites and all the methods are trying to find a balance to represent more peaks with least samples. 2.4 Optimization One experiment can contain lots of factors with different levels and only one set of parameters for different factors will show the best sensitivity or reproducibility for certain study. To find this set of parameters, Plackett-Burman Design (PBD), Response Surface Methodology (RSM), Central Composite Design (CCD), and Taguchi methods could be used to optimize the parameters for metabolomics study. The target could be the quality of peaks, the numbers of peaks, the stability of peaks intensity, and/or the statistics of the combination of those targets. You could check those paper for details(Jacyna, Kordalewska, and Markuszewski 2019; Box, Hunter, and Hunter 2005). 2.5 Pooled QC Pooled QC samples are unique and very important for metabolomics study. Every 10 or 20 samples, a pooled sample from all samples and blank sample in one study should be injected as quality control samples. Pooled QC samples contain the changes during the instrumental analysis and blank samples could tell where the variances come from. Meanwhile the cap of sequence should old the column with pooled QC samples. The injection sequence should be randomized. Those papers(Phapale et al. 2020; Dudzik et al. 2018; Dunn et al. 2012) should be read for details. If there are other co-factors, a linear model or randomizing would be applied to eliminate their influences. You need to record the values of those co-factors for further data analysis. Common co-factors in metabolomics studies are age, gender, location, etc. If you need data correction, some background or calibration samples are required. However, control samples could also be used for data correction in certain DoE. Another important factors are instrumentals. High-resolution mass spectrum is always preferred. As shown in Lukas’s study (Najdekr et al. 2016): the most effective mass resolving powers for profiling analyses of metabolite rich biofluids on the Orbitrap Elite were around 60000–120000 fwhm to retrieve the highest amount of information. The region between 400–800 m/z was influenced the most by resolution. However, elimination of peaks with high RSD% within group were always omitted by most study. Based on pre-experiment, you could get a description of RSD% distribution and set cut-off to use stable peaks for further data analysis. To my knowledge, 30% is suitable considering the batch effects. 2.6 Software MetSizeR GUI Tool for Estimating Sample Sizes for metabolomics Experiments(Nyamundanda et al. 2013).

"],["pretreatment.html", "Chapter 3 Pretreatment 3.1 Collection 3.2 Quenching 3.3 Extraction 3.4 Derivatization 3.5 Storage", " Chapter 3 Pretreatment Pretreatment will affect the results of metabolomics and cover the sample treatment from crude samples to injection vials for instrumental analysis. The purpose of sample pretreatment is the to retain more interesting compounds while remove unrelated compounds. For metabolomics studies, we might not know ‘interesting’ compounds in advance and the unrelated compounds are highly depended on research purpose. For example, Gel Permeation Chromatograph(GPC), Florisil, Alumina, Silica gel could be used to remove lipid while alcohols and strong acid/base could make protein denaturation to release more compounds. However, if we are interested in small lipid or peptide, such pretreatment methods should be changed. In general, sample collection, quenching, extraction methods, derivatization, and storage should be optimized in pretreatment. 3.1 Collection Those papers investigated different fecal collection methods(Loftfield et al. 2016; Deda et al. 2017). 3.2 Quenching Quenching solvent is always used to stop stop enzymatic activity. In this review(W. Lu et al. 2017), authors said: A classical approach, which works well for many analytes, is boiling ethanol. Although the boiling solvent raises concerns about thermal degradation, it reliably denatures enzymes. In contrast, cold organic solvent may not fully denature enzymes or may do so too slowly such that some metabolic reactions continue, interconverting metabolites during the quenching process. This review(Kim et al. 2020) summarized the urease-dependent metabolome sample preparation and found: activities of urease and endogenous urinary enzymes and metabolite contaminants from the urease preparations introduce artefacts into metabolite profiles, thus leading to misinterpretation. 3.3 Extraction According to this research(Bennett et al. 2009): The total metabolome concentration is approximately 300 mM, whereas the protein concentration is approximately 7 mM., which implies that most cellular metabolites are in free form. Dmitri et.al(Sitnikov, Monnin, and Vuckovic 2016) thought the most orthogonal methods to methanol-based precipitation were ion-exchange solid-phase extraction and liquid-liquid extraction using methyl-tertbutyl ether. Metabolic information was highly influenced by the extraction solvent(Ibáñez et al. 2017). Tissue samples need to first be pulverized into fine powders. Feces collected with 95% ethanol or FOBT would be more reproducible and stable. In this review(W. Lu et al. 2017), authors said: In our experience, for both cell and tissue specimens, 40:40:20 acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid (and subsequent neutralization with ammonium bicarbonate) is generally an effective solvent system for both quenching and extraction, including for ATP and other high-energy phosphorylated compounds. We typically use approximately 1 mL of solvent mix to extract 25 mg of biological specimen. …Thus, although drying is acceptable for most metabolites, care must be taken with redox-active species. nano LC-MS could be used to analysis small numbers of cells(Luo and Li 2017). For plant like soybeans(Mahmud et al. 2017), ammonium acetate/methanol could be selected as extraction strategies compared with water/methanol and sodium phosphate/methanol. For general plant samples, check this comprehensive investigation(Bijttebier et al. 2016). 3.4 Derivatization Derivatization is always used in GC-based metabolomics study. This paper(Miyagawa and Bamba 2019) compared sequential derivatization methods and found different compounds would show different fluctuations during oximation or silylation process. 3.5 Storage Samples should be stored after sample collection or sample pretreatment. -80°C or -20°C is always preferred to store samples. Dry ice should be used during sample pretreatment. However, comprehensive investigation of storage influences found the metabolites profile will change after one day storage at -80°C(Yu et al. 2020) . Rapid analysis of samples should be considered to capture more accurate information in the samples. Storage conditions such as temperature and time can affect the metabolite composition of various samples. Laparre et al.(Laparre et al. 2017a) noted that the metabolite profiles of urine samples were significantly changed after 5 days of storage at 4 C, while Wandro and colleagues(Wandro et al. 2017) observed that the metabolomic profiles of cystic fibrosis sputum samples underwent notable changes after only 1 day of storage at 4 C. Likewise, Roszkowska et al. demonstrated that various signaling molecules were lost from the lipidome profile of tissue after storing the samples for one year at 80 C (Roszkowska et al. 2018). To date, most metabolomics studies involving storage of samples prior to the analysis have used a storage temperature of 80 C, as previous investigations have shown that low temperatures or freeze-thaw cycles do not significantly change the metabolite profile of certain samples(Lin et al. 2007) . For gut microbiota, this paper could be checked for storage issue(Zubeldia-Varela et al. 2020). For blood sample storage, you could check this paper(Hernandes, Barbas, and Dudzik 2017). For urine sample storage, check this(Laparre et al. 2017b). This piece reviewed the stability of energy metabolites(Gil et al. 2015). "],["instrumental-analysis.html", "Chapter 4 Instrumental analysis 4.1 Column and gradient selection 4.2 Mass resolution", " Chapter 4 Instrumental analysis To get more information in the samples, full scan is preferred on GC/LC-MS. Each scan would collect a mass spectrum to cover the setting mass range. If you narrow down your mass range and keep the same scan time, each mass would gain the collection time and you would get a higher sensitivity. However, if you expand your scan range, the sensitivity for each mass would decrease. You could also extend the collection time for each scan. However, it would affect the separation process. Full scan is performed synchronously with the separation process. For a better separation on chromotograph, each peak should have at least 10 point to get a nice peak shape. If you want to separate two peaks with a retention time differences of 10s. Assuming the half peak width is 5s, you need to collect 10 mass spectrum within 10s. So the drwell time for each scan is 1s. If you use a high resolution column and the half peak width is 1s, you need to finish a scan within 0.2s. As we discussed above, shorter dwell time would decrease the sensitivity. Thus there is a trade-off between separation and sensitivity. If you use UPLC, the separation could be finished within 20 min while you need to calculate if you mass spectrometry could still show a good sensitivity. 4.1 Column and gradient selection For GC, higher temperature could release compounds with higher boiling point. For LC, gradient and functional groups of stationary phase would be more important than temperature. Polarity of samples and column should match. More polar solvent could release polar compounds. Normal-phase column will not retain non-polar compounds while reversed-phase will elute polar column in the very beginning. To cover a wide polarity range or logP value compounds, normal phase column should match with non-polar to polar gradient to get a better separation of polar compounds while reverse phase column should match with polar to non-polar gradient to elute compounds. If you use an inappropriate order of gradient, you compounds would not be separated well. If you have no idea about column and gradient selection, literature’s condition might help. 4.2 Mass resolution For metabolomics, high resolution mass spectrum should be used to make identification of compounds easier. The Mass Resolving Power is very important for annotation and high resolution mass spectrum should be calibrated in real time. The region between 400–800 m/z was influenced the most by resolution(Najdekr et al. 2016). Orbitrap Fusion’s performance was evaluated here(Barbier Saint Hilaire et al. 2018).

To make it clear, the structure of those data could be summarised as: Indexed scan with time-stamp Each scan contains a full scan mass spectra Common formats for open source mass spectrum data are mzxml, mzml or CDF. However, masscomp might shrink the data size(yang2019b?). 5.1 Data visualization You could use msxpertsuite for MS data visualization. It is biological mass spectrometry data visualization and mining with full JavaScript ability(rusconi2019?). 5.2 Peak extraction GC/LC-MS data are usually be shown as a matrix with column standing for retention times and row standing for masses after bin them into small cell. Figure 5.1: Demo of GC/LC-MS data Conversation from the mass-retention time matrix into a vector with selected MS peaks at certain retention time is the basic idea of Peak extraction. You could EIC for each mass to charge ratio and use the change of trace slope to determine whether there is a peak or not. Then we could make integration for this peak and get peak area and retention time. intensity &lt;- c(10,10,10,10,10,14,19,25,30,33,26,21,16,12,11,10,9,10,11,10) time &lt;- c(1:20) plot(intensity~time, type = &#39;o&#39;, main = &#39;EIC&#39;) Figure 5.2: Demo of EIC with peak However, due to the accuracy of instrument, the detected mass to charge ratio would have some shift and EIC would fail if different scan get the intensity from different mass to charge ratio. In the matchedfilter algorithm(smith2006?), they solve this issue by bin the data in m/z dimension. The adjacent chromatographic slices could be combined to find a clean signal fitting fixed second-derivative Gaussian with full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of 30s to find peaks with about 1.5-4 times the signal peak width. The the integration is performed on the fitted area. Figure 5.3: Demo of matchedfilter The Centwave algorithm(tautenhahn2008?) based on detection of regions of interest(ROI) and the following Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is preferred for high-resolution mass spectrum. ROI means a regine with stable mass for a certain time. When we find the ROIs, the peak shape is evaluated and ROI could be extended if needed. This algotithm use prefilter to accelerate the processing speed. prefilter with 3 and 100 means the ROI should contain 3 scan with intensity above 100. Centwave use a peak width range which should be checked on pool QC. Another important parameter is ppm. It is the maximum allowed deviation between scans when locating regions of interest (ROIs), which is different from vendor number and you need to extend them larger than the company claimed. For profparam, it’s used for fill peaks or align peaks instead of peak picking. snthr is the cutoff of signal to noise ratio. 5.3 Retention Time Correction For single file, we could get peaks. However, we should make the peaks align across samples for subsquece analysis and retention time corrections should be performed. The basic idea behind retention time correction is that use the high quality grouped peaks to make a new retention time. You might choose obiwarp(for dramatic shifts) or loess regression(fast) method to get the corrected retention time for all of the samples. Remember the original retention times might be changed and you might need cross-correct the data. After the correction, you could group the peaks again for a better cross-sample peaks list. However, if you directly use obiwarp, you don’t have to group peaks before correction. (fu2017?) show a matlab based shift correction methods. 5.4 Filling missing values Too many zeros or NA in peaks list are problematic for statistics. Then we usually need to integreate the area exsiting a peak. xcms 3 could use profile matrix to fill the blank. They also have function to impute the NA data by replace missing values with a proportion of the row minimum or random numbers based on the row minimum. It depends on the user to select imputation methods as well as control the minimum fraction of featuers appeared in single group. Figure 5.4: Peak filling of GC/LC-MS data With many groups of samples, you will get another data matrix with column standing for peaks at cerntain retention time and row standing for samples after the Raw data pretreatment. Figure 5.5: Demo of many GC/LC-MS data 5.5 Spectral deconvolution Without fracmental infomation about certain compound, the peak extraction would suffer influnces from other compounds. At the same retention time, co-elute compounds might share similar mass. Hard electron ionization methods such as electron impact ionization (EI), APPI suffer this issue. So it would be hard to distighuish the co-elute peaks’ origin and deconvolution method(du2013?) could be used to seperate different groups according to the similar chromatogragh beheviors. Another computational tool eRah could be a better solution for the whole process(domingo-almenara2016?). Also the ADAD-GC3.0 could also be helpful for such issue(ni2016?). 5.6 Dynamic Range Another issue is the Dynamic Range. For metabolomics, peaks could be below the detection limit or over the detection limit. Such Dynamic range issues might raise the loss of information. 5.6.1 Non-detects Some of the data were limited by the detect of limitation. Thus we need some methods to impute the data if we don’t want to lose information by deleting the NA or 0. Two major imputation way could be used. The first way is use model-free method such as half the minimum of the values across the data, 0, 1, mean/median across the data( enviGCMS package could do this via getimputation function). The second way is use model-based method such as linear model, random forest, KNN, PCA. Try simputation package for various imputation methods. As mentioned before, you could also use imputeRowMin or imputeRowMinRand within xcms package to perform imputation. Tobit regression is preferred for censored data.

However, we could perform power analysis after the experiment done. That is, we just rule out the peaks with a lower power in exsit Exprimental design. 5.9 Software 5.9.1 Peak picking ProteoWizard Toolkit provides a set of open-source, cross-platform software libraries and tools (chambers2012?).

There are three types of those batch effects: Monotone, Block and Mixed. Monotone would increase/decrease with the injection order or batchs. Block would be system shift among different batchs. Mixed would be the combination of monotone and block batch effects. Meanwhile, different compounds would suffer different type of batch effects. In this case, the normalization or batch correction should be done peak by peak. 6.2 Batch effects visulization Any correction might introduce bias. We need to make sure there are patterns which different from our experimental design. Pooled QC samples should be clustered on PCA score plot. 6.3 Source of batch effects Different Operators &amp; Dates &amp; Sequences Different Instrumental Condition such as different instrumental parameters, poor quality control, sample contamination during the analysis, Column (Pooled QC) and sample matrix effects (ions suppression or/and enhancement) Unknown Unknowns 6.4 Avoid batch effects by DoE You could avoid batch effects from experimental design. Cap the sequence with Pooled QC and Randomized samples sequence. Some internal standards/Instrumental QC might Help to find the source of batch effects while it’s not practical for every compounds in non-targeted analysis. Batch effects might not change the conclusion when the effect size is relatively small. Here is a simulation: set.seed(30) # real peaks group &lt;- factor(c(rep(1,5),rep(2,5))) con &lt;- c(rnorm(5,5),rnorm(5,8)) re &lt;- t.test(con~group) # real peaks group &lt;- factor(c(rep(1,5),rep(2,5))) con &lt;- c(rnorm(5,5),rnorm(5,8)) batch &lt;- seq(0,5,length.out = 10) ins &lt;- batch+con re &lt;- t.test(ins~group) index &lt;- sample(10) ins &lt;- batch+con[index] re &lt;- t.test(ins~group[index]) Randomization could not guarantee the results.

Batch effect should have patterns, otherwise just noise. Correction is possible by data analysis/randomized experimental design. There are more than 20 methods to make normalization. We could devided those methods into two category: unsupervised and supervised. Unsupervised methods only consider the normalization peaks intensity distribution across the samples. For example, quantile calibration try to make the intensity distribution among the samples similar. Such methods are preferred to explore the inner structures of the samples. Internal standards or pool QC samples also belong to this category. However, it’s hard to take a few peaks standing for all peaks extracted. Supervised methods will use the group information or batch information in experimental design to normalize the data. A linear model is always used to model the unwanted variances and remove them for further analysis. Since the real batch effects are always unknown, it’s hard to make validation for different normalization methods. Wu et.al preferred to make comparision between new methods and conventional methods(wu2016?). Li et.al developed NOREVA to make comparision among 25 correction method(li2017a?). Another idea is use spiked-in samples to validate the methods(franceschi2012?), which might be good for targeted analysis instead of non-targeted analysis. Relative log abundance (RLA) plots(delivera2012?) and heatmap often used to show the variances among the samples. (thonusin2017?) some methods for batch correction in excel 6.5.1 Unsupervised methods 6.5.1.1 Distribution of intensity Intensity collects from LC/GC-MS always showed a right-skewed distribution. Log transformation is often necessary for further statistical analysis. 6.5.1.2 Centering For peak p of sample s in batch b, the corrected abundance I is: \\[\\hat I_{p,s,b} = I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b}) + median(I_{p,qc})\\] If no quality control samples used, the corrected abundance I would be: \\[\\hat I_{p,s,b} = I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b})\\] 6.5.1.3 Scaling For peak p of sample s in certain batch b, the corrected abundance I is: \\[\\hat I_{p,s,b} = \\frac{I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b})}{std_{p,b}} * std_{p,qc,b} + mean(I_{p,qc,b})\\] If no quality control samples used, the corrected abundance I would be: \\[\\hat I_{p,s,b} = \\frac{I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b})}{std_{p,b}}\\] 6.5.1.4 Pareto Scaling For peak p of sample s in certain batch b, the corrected abundance I is: \\[\\hat I_{p,s,b} = \\frac{I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b})}{Sqrt(std_{p,b})} * Sqrt(std_{p,qc,b}) + mean(I_{p,qc,b})\\] If no quality control samples used, the corrected abundance I would be: \\[\\hat I_{p,s,b} = \\frac{I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b})}{Sqrt(std_{p,b})}\\] 6.5.1.5 Range Scaling For peak p of sample s in certain batch b, the corrected abundance I is: \\[\\hat I_{p,s,b} = \\frac{I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b})}{max(I_{p,b}) - min(I_{p,b})} * (max(I_{p,qc,b}) - min(I_{p,qc,b})) + mean(I_{p,qc,b})\\] If no quality control samples used, the corrected abundance I would be: \\[\\hat I_{p,s,b} = \\frac{I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b})}{max(I_{p,b}) - min(I_{p,b})} \\] 6.5.1.6 Level scaling For peak p of sample s in certain batch b, the corrected abundance I is: \\[\\hat I_{p,s,b} = \\frac{I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b})}{mean(I_{p,b})} * mean(I_{p,qc,b}) + mean(I_{p,qc,b})\\] If no quality control samples used, the corrected abundance I would be: \\[\\hat I_{p,s,b} = \\frac{I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b})}{mean(I_{p,b})} \\] 6.5.1.7 Quantile The idea of quantile calibration is that alignment of the intensities in certain samples according to quantiles in each sample. Here is the demo: set.seed(42) a &lt;- rnorm(1000) # b sufferred batch effect with a bias of 10 b &lt;- rnorm(1000,10) hist(a,xlim=c(-5,15),breaks = 50) hist(b,col = &#39;black&#39;, breaks = 50, add=T) # quantile normalized cor &lt;- (a[order(a)]+b[order(b)])/2 # reorder cor &lt;- cor[order(order(a))] hist(cor,col = &#39;red&#39;, breaks = 50, add=T) 6.5.1.8 Ratio based calibraton This method calibrates samples by the ratio between qc samples in all samples and in certain batch.For peak p of sample s in certain batch b, the corrected abundance I is: \\[\\hat I_{p,s,b} = \\frac{I_{p,s,b} * median(I_{p,qc})}{mean_{p,qc,b}}\\] set.seed(42) # raw data I = c(rnorm(10,mean = 0, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 1, sd = 0.5)) # batch B = c(rep(0,10),rep(1,10)) # qc Iqc = c(rnorm(1,mean = 0, sd = 0.3),rnorm(1,mean = 1, sd = 0.5)) # corrected data Icor = I * median(c(rep(Iqc[1],10),rep(Iqc[2],10)))/mean(c(rep(Iqc[1],10),rep(Iqc[2],10))) # plot the result plot(I) plot(Icor) 6.5.1.9 Linear Normalizer This method initially scales each sample so that the sum of all peak abundances equals one. In this study, by multiplying the median sum of all peak abundances across all samples,we got the corrected data. set.seed(42) # raw data peaksa &lt;- c(rnorm(10,mean = 10, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 20, sd = 0.5)) peaksb &lt;- c(rnorm(10,mean = 10, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 20, sd = 0.5)) df &lt;- rbind(peaksa,peaksb) dfcor &lt;- df/apply(df,2,sum)* sum(apply(df,2,median)) image(df) image(dfcor) 6.5.1.10 Internal standards \\[\\hat I_{p,s} = \\frac{I_{p,s} * median(I_{IS})}{I_{IS,s}}\\] Some methods also use pooled calibration samples and multiple internal standard strategy to correct the data(van_der_kloet2009?). Also some methods only use QC samples to handle the data(kuligowski2015?). 6.5.2 Supervised methods 6.5.2.1 Regression calibration Considering the batch effect of injection order, regress the data by a linear model to get the calibration. 6.5.2.2 Batch Normalizer Use the total abundance scale and then fit with the regression line(wang2013?). 6.5.2.3 Surrogate Variable Analysis(SVA) We have a data matrix(M*N) with M stands for indentity peaks from one sample and N stand for individual samples. For one sample, \\(X = (x_{i1},...,x_{in})^T\\) stands for the normalized intensities of peaks. We use \\(Y = (y_i,...,y_m)^T\\) stands for the group infomation of our data. Then we could build such modles: \\[x_{ij} = \\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + e_{ij}\\] \\(\\mu_i\\) stands for the baseline of the peak intensities in a normal state. Then we have: \\[f_i(y_i) = E(x_{ij}|y_j) - \\mu_i\\] stands for the biological variations caused by the our group, for example, whether treated by pollutions or not. However, considering the batch effects, the real model could be: \\[x_{ij} = \\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \\sum_{l = 1}^L \\gamma_{li}p_{lj} + e_{ij}^*\\] \\(\\gamma_{li}\\) stands for the peak-specific coefficient for potentical factor \\(l\\). \\(p_{lj}\\) stands for the potential factors across the samples. Actually, the error item \\(e_{ij}\\) in real sample could always be decomposed as \\(e_{ij} = \\sum_{l = 1}^L \\gamma_{li}p_{lj} + e_{ij}^*\\) with \\(e_{ij}^*\\) standing for the real random error in certain sample for certain peak. We could not get the potential factors directly. Since we don’t care the details of the unknown factors, we could estimate orthogonal vectors \\(h_k\\) standing for such potential factors. Thus we have: \\[ x_{ij} = \\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \\sum_{l = 1}^L \\gamma_{li}p_{lj} + e_{ij}^*\\\\ = \\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \\sum_{k = 1}^K \\lambda_{ki}h_{kj} + e_{ij} \\] Here is the details of the algorithm: The algorithm is decomposed into two parts: detection of unmodeled factors and construction of surrogate variables 6.5.2.3.1 Detection of unmodeled factors Estimate \\(\\hat\\mu_i\\) and \\(f_i\\) by fitting the model \\(x_{ij} = \\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + e_{ij}\\) and get the residual \\(r_{ij} = x_{ij}-\\hat\\mu_i - \\hat f_i(y_i)\\). Then we have the residual matrix R. Perform the singular value decompositon(SVD) of the residual matrix \\(R = UDV^T\\) Let \\(d_l\\) be the \\(l\\)th eigenvalue of the diagonal matrix D for \\(l = 1,...,n\\). Set \\(df\\) as the freedom of the model \\(\\hat\\mu_i + \\hat f_i(y_i)\\). We could build a statistic \\(T_k\\) as: \\[T_k = \\frac{d_k^2}{\\sum_{l=1}^{n-df}d_l^2}\\] to show the variance explained by the \\(k\\)th eigenvalue. Permute each row of R to remove the structure in the matrix and get \\(R^*\\). Fit the model \\(r_{ij}^* = \\mu_i^* + f_i^*(y_i) + e^*_{ij}\\) and get \\(r_{ij}^0 = r^*_{ij}-\\hat\\mu^*_i - \\hat f^*_i(y_i)\\) as a null matrix \\(R_0\\) Perform the singular value decompositon(SVD) of the residual matrix \\(R_0 = U_0D_0V_0^T\\) Compute the null statistic: \\[ T_k^0 = \\frac{d_{0k}^2}{\\sum_{l=1}^{n-df}d_{0l}^2} \\] Repeat permuting the row B times to get the null statistics \\(T_k^{0b}\\) Get the p-value for eigengene: \\[p_k = \\frac{\\#{T_k^{0b}\\geq T_k;b=1,...,B }}{B}\\] For a significance level \\(\\alpha\\), treat k as a significant signature of residual R if \\(p_k\\leq\\alpha\\) 6.5.2.3.2 Construction of surrogate variables Estimate \\(\\hat\\mu_i\\) and \\(f_i\\) by fitting the model \\(x_{ij} = \\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + e_{ij}\\) and get the residual \\(r_{ij} = x_{ij}-\\hat\\mu_i - \\hat f_i(y_i)\\). Then we have the residual matrix R. Perform the singular value decompositon(SVD) of the residual matrix \\(R = UDV^T\\). Let \\(e_k = (e_{k1},...,e_{kn})^T\\) be the \\(k\\)th column of V Set \\(\\hat K\\) as the significant eigenvalues found by the first step. Regress each \\(e_k\\) on \\(x_i\\), get the p-value for the association. Set \\(\\pi_0\\) as the proportion of the peak intensitity \\(x_i\\) not associate with \\(e_k\\) and find the numbers \\(\\hat m =[1-\\hat \\pi_0 \\times m]\\) and the indices of the peaks associated with the eigenvalues Form the matrix \\(\\hat m_1 \\times N\\), this matrix\\(X_r\\) stand for the potiential variables. As was done for R, get the eigengents of \\(X_r\\) and denote these by \\(e_j^r\\) Let \\(j^* = argmax_{1\\leq j \\leq n}cor(e_k,e_j^r)\\) and set \\(\\hat h_k=e_j^r\\). Set the estimate of the surrogate variable to be the eigenvalue of the reduced matrix most correlated with the corresponding residual eigenvalue. Since the reduced matrix is enriched for peaks associated with this residual eigenvalue, this is a principled choice for the estimated surrogate variable that allows for correlation with the primary variable. Employ the \\(\\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \\sum_{k = 1}^K \\gamma_{ki}\\hat h_{kj} + e_{ij}\\) as te estimate of the ideal model \\(\\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \\sum_{k = 1}^K \\gamma_{ki}h_{kj} + e_{ij}\\) This method could found the potentical unwanted variables for the data. SVA were introduced by Jeff Leek(leek2012?; leek2007?; leek2008?) and EigenMS package implement SVA with modifications including analysis of data with missing values that are typical in LC-MS experiments(karpievitch2014a?). 6.5.2.4 RUV (Remove Unwanted Variation) This method’s performance is similar to SVA. Instead find surrogate variable from the whole dataset. RUA use control or pool QC to find the unwanted variances and remove them to find the peaks related to experimental design. However, we could also empirically estimate the control peaks by linear mixed model. RUA-random(livera2015?) furthor use linear mixed model to estimate the variances of random error. This method could be used with suitable control, which is commen in metabolomics DoE. 6.5.2.5 RRmix RRmix also use a latent factor models correct the data(jr2017?). This method could be treated as linear mixed model version SVA. No control samples are required and the unwanted variances could be removed by factor analysis. This method might be the best choise to remove the unwanted variables with commen experiment design. 6.6 Method to validate the normalization 6.7 Software BatchCorrMetabolomics is for improved batch correction in untargeted MS-based metabolomics MetNorm show Statistical Methods for Normalizing Metabolomics Data.

Check this review(Domingo-Almenara et al. 2018) for a detailed notes on annotation. They proposed five levels regarding currently computational annotation strategies. Level 1: Peak Grouping: MS Psedospectra extraction based on peak shape similarity and peak abundance correlation Level 2: Peak Annotation: Adducts, Neutral losses, isotopes, and other mass relationships based on mass distances Level 3: Biochemical knowledge based on putative identification, potential biochemical reaction and related statistical analysis Level 4: Use and integration of tandem MS data based on data dependent/independent acquisition mode or in silico prediction Level 5: Retention time prediction based on library-available retention index or quantitative structure-retention relationships (QSRR) models. Most of the software are at level 1 or 2. If we only have compounds structure, we could guess ions under different ionization method. If we have mass spectrum, we could match the mass spectral by a similarity analysis to the database. In metabolomics, we only have mass spectrum or mass-to-charge ratios. Single mass-to-charge ratio is not enough for identification. That’s the one bottleneck for annotation. So prediction is always performed on MS/MS data. 7.1 Issues in annotation The major issue in annotation is the redundancy peaks from same metabolite. Unlike genomes, peaks or features from peak selection are not independent with each other. Adducts, in-source fragments and isotopes would lead to wrong annotation. A common solution is that use known adducts, neutral losses, molecular multimers or multiple charged ions to compare mass distances. Another issue is about the MS/MS database. Only 10% of known metabolites in databases have experimental spectral data. Thus in silico prediction are required. Some works try to fill the gap between experimental data, theoretical values(from chemical database like chemspider) and prediction together. Here is a nice review about MS/MS prediction(hufsky2014?). 7.2 Peak misidentification Isomer Use separation methods such as chromatography, ion mobility MS, MS/MS. Reversed-phase ion-pairing chromatography and HILIC is useful. Chemical derivatization is another options. Interfering compounds 20ppm is the least resolution and accuracy for HRMS. In-source degradation products 7.3 Annotation v.s. identification According to the definition from the Chemical Analysis Working Group of the Metabolomics Standards Intitvative(sumner2007?; viant2017?). Four levels of confidence could be assigned to identification: Level 1 ‘identified metabolites’ Level 2 ‘Putatively annotated compounds’ Level 3 ‘Putatively characterised compound classes’ Level 4 ‘Unknown’ In practice, data analysis based annotation could reach level 2. For level 1, we need at extra methods such as MS/MS, retention time, accurate mass, 2D NMR spectra, and so on to confirm the compounds. However, standards are always required for solid proof. 7.4 Molecular Formula Assignment Cheminformatics will help for MS annotation. The first task is molecular formula assignment. For a given accurate mass, the formula should be constrained by predefined element type and atom number, mass error window and rules of chemical bonding, such as double bond equivalent (DBE) and the nitrogen rule. The nitrogen rule is that an odd nominal molecular mass implies also an odd number of nitrogen. This rule should only be used with nominal (integer) masses. Degree of unsaturation or DBE use rings-plus-double-bonds equivalent (RDBE) values, which should be interger. The elements oxygen and sulphur were not taken into account. Otherwise the molecular formula will not be true. \\[RDBE = C+Si - 1/2(H+F+Cl+Br+I) + 1/2(N+P)+1 \\] To assign molecular formula to a mass to charge ratio, Seven Golden Rules (kind2007?) for heuristic filtering of molecular formulas should be considered: Apply heuristic restrictions for number of elements during formula generation. This is the table for known compounds: ## Mass.Range.[Da] Library C.max H.max N.max O.max P.max ## 1 &lt; 500 DNP 29 72 10 18 4 ## 2 &lt;NA&gt; Wiley 39 72 20 20 9 ## 3 &lt; 1000 DNP 66 126 25 27 6 ## 4 &lt;NA&gt; Wiley 78 126 20 27 9 ## 5 &lt; 2000 DNP 115 236 32 63 6 ## 6 &lt;NA&gt; Wiley 156 180 20 40 9 ## 7 &lt; 3000 DNP 162 208 48 78 6 ## S.max F.max Cl.max Br.max Si.max ## 1 7 15 8 5 NA ## 2 10 16 10 4 8 ## 3 8 16 11 8 NA ## 4 14 34 12 8 14 ## 5 8 16 11 8 NA ## 6 14 48 12 10 15 ## 7 9 16 11 8 NA Perform LEWIS and SENIOR check. The LEWIS rule demands that molecules consisting of main group elements, especially carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, share electrons in a way that all atoms have completely filled s, p-valence shells (‘octet rule’). Senior’s theorem requires three essential conditions for the existence of molecular graphs The sum of valences or the total number of atoms having odd valences is even; The sum of valences is greater than or equal to twice the maximum valence; The sum of valences is greater than or equal to twice the number of atoms minus 1. Perform isotopic pattern filter. Isotope ratio abundance was included in the algorithm as an additional orthogonal constraint, assuming high quality data acquisitions, specifically sufficient ion statistics and high signal/noise ratio for the detection of the M+1 and M+2 abundances. For monoisotopic elements (F, Na, P, I) this rule has no impact. isotope pattern will be useful for brominated, chlorinated small molecules and sulphur-containing peptides.

For TMS derivatized molecules detected in GC/MS analyses, the rules on element ratio checks and valence tests are hence best applied after TMS groups are subtracted, in a similar manner as adducts need to be first recognized and subtracted in LC/MS analyses. Seven Golden Rules were built for GC-MS and Hydrogen Rearrangement Rules were major designed for LC-CID-MS/MS(tsugawa2016?). Based on extensively curated database records and enthalpy calculations, “hydrogen rearrangement (HR) rules” could be extending the even-electron rule for carbon (C) and heteroatoms, oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S). They used high abundance MS/MS peaks that exceeded 10% of their base peaks to identify common features in terms of 4 HR rules for positive mode and 5 HR rules for negative mode. Seven Golden Rules and Hydrogen Rearrangement Rules might also be captured by statistical models. However, such heuristic rules could reduce the searching space of possible formula. Here is some other Cheminformatics tools, which could be used to assign meanful formula or structures for mass spectra. RDKit Open-Source Cheminformatics Software cdk The Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) is a scientific, LGPL-ed library for bio- and cheminformatics and computational chemistry written in Java. Open Babel Open Babel is a chemical toolbox designed to speak the many languages of chemical data. 7.5 Chromatographic retention-related criteria For targeted analysis, chromatographic retention time could be the qualitative method for certain compounds with a carefully designed pre-treatment. For untargeted analysis, such information could also be used for annotation. GC-MS usually use retention index for certain column while LC-MS might not show enough reproducible results as GC. Such method could be tracked back to quantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) models or linear solvation energy relationship (LSER). However, such methods need molecular descriptors as much as possible. For untargeted analysis, retention time and mass to charge ratio could not generate enough molecular descriptors to build QSPR models. In this case, such criteria might be usefully for validation instead of annotation unless we could measure or extract more information such as ion mobility from unknown compounds. 7.6 MS Database for annotation 7.6.1 MS/MS MoNA Platform to collect all other open source database MassBank GNPS use inner correlationship in the data and make network analysis at peaks’ level instand of annotated compounds to annotate the data(wang2016b?).

However, since metabolomics are usually performed in a non-targeted mode, statistical analysis methods are always started with the exploratory analysis. The basic target for an exploratory analysis is: Find the relationship among variables Find the relationship among samples/group of samples. This is basically unsurpvised analysis. However, sometimes we have group information which could be used to find biomarkers or correlationship between variables and groups or continous variables. This type of data need supervised methods to process. Before we talk the details of algorithms, let’s cover some basic statistical concepts. 9.1 Basic Statistical Analysis Statistic is used to describe certain property or variables among the samples. It could be designed for certain purpose to extract signal and remove noise. Statistical models and inference are both based on statistic instead of the data. \\[Statistic = f(sample_1,sample_2,...,sample_n)\\] Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) is often used to make statistical inference. P value is the probability of certain statistics happens under H0 (pre-defined distribution). For omics studies, you should realise Multiple Comparision issue when you perform a lot of(more than 20) comparisions or tests at the same time. False Discovery Rate(FDR) control is required for multiple tests to make sure the results are not false positive. You could use Benjamini-Hochberg method to adjust raw p values or directly use Storey Q value to make FDR control. NHST is famous for the failure of p-value interpretation as well as multiple comparision issues. Bayesian Hypothesis Testing could be an options to cover some drawbacks of NHST. Bayesian Hypothesis Testing use Bayes factor to show the differences between null hypothesis and any other hypothesis. \\[Bayes\\ factor = \\frac{p(D|Ha)}{p(D|H0)} = \\frac{posterior\\ odds}{prior\\ odds}\\] Statistical model use statistics to make prediction/explanation. Most of the statistical model need to be tuned for parpameters to show a better performance. Statistical model is build on real data and could be diagnosed by other general statistics such as \\(R^2\\), \\(ROC curve\\). When the models are built or compared, model selection could be preformed. \\[Target = g(Statistic) = g(f(sample_1,sample_2,...,sample_n))\\] Bias-Variance Tradeoff is an important concept regarding statistical models. Certain models could be overfitted(small Bias, large variance) or underfitted(large Bias, small variance) when the parameters of models are not well selected. \\[E[(y - \\hat f)^2] = \\sigma^2 + Var[\\hat f] + Bias[\\hat f]\\] Cross validation could be used to find the best model based on training-testing strategy such as Jacknife, bootstraping resampling and n-fold cross validation. Regularization for models could also be used to find the model with best prediction performance. Rigid regression, LASSO or other general regularization could be employed to build a robust models. For supervised models, linear model and tree based model are two basic categories. Linear model could be useful to tell the independant or correlated relationship of variables and the influnces on the predicted variables. Tree based model, on the other hand, try to build a hierarchical structure for the variables such as bagging, random forest or boosting. Linear model could be treated as special case of tree based model with single layer. Other models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or Deep Learning are also make various assumptions on the data. However, if you final target is prediction, you could try any of those models or even weighted combine their prediciton to make meta-prediction. 9.2 Differences analysis After we get corrected peaks across samples, the next step is to find the differences between two groups. Actually, you could perform ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis Test for comparison among more than two groups. The basic idea behind statistic analysis is to find the meaningful differences between groups and extract such ions or peak groups. So how to find the differences? In most metabolomics software, such task is completed by a t-test and report p-value and fold changes. If you only compare two groups on one peaks, that’s OK. However, if you compare two groups on thousands of peaks, statistic textbook would tell you to notice the false positive. For one comparasion, the confidence level is 0.05, which means 5% chances to get false positive result. For two comparasions, such chances would be \\(1-0.95^2\\). For 10 comparasions, such chances would be \\(1-0.95^{10} = 0.4012631\\). For 100 comparasions, such chances would be \\(1-0.95^{100} = 0.9940795\\). You would almost certainly to make mistakes for your results. In statistics, the false discovery rate(FDR) control is always mentioned in omics studies for mutiple tests. I suggested using q-values to control FDR. If q-value is less than 0.05, we should expect a lower than 5% chances we make the wrong selections for all of the comparisions showed lower q-values in the whole dataset. Also we could use local false discovery rate, which showed the FDR for certain peaks. However, such values are hard to be estimated accurately. Karin Ortmayr thought fold change might be better than p-values to find the differences(ortmayr2016a?). 9.2.1 T-test or ANOVA If one peak show significant differences among two groups or multiple groups, T-test or ANOVA could be used to find such peaks. However, when multiple hypothesis testings are performed, the probability of false positive would increase. In this case, false discovery rate(FDR) control is required. Q value or adjusted p value could be used in this situation. At certain confidence interval, we could find peaks with significant differences after FDR control. 9.2.2 LIMMA Linear Models for MicroArray Data(LIMMA) model could also be used for high-dimensional data like metabolomics. They use a moderated t-statistic to make estimation of the effects called Empirical Bayes Statistics for Differential Expression. It is a hierarchical model to shrink the t-statistic for each peak to all the peaks. Such estimation is more robust. In LIMMA, we could add the known batch effect variable as a covariance in the model. LIMMA is different from t-test or ANOVA while we could still use p value and FDR control on LIMMA results. 9.2.3 Bayesian mixture model Another way to make difference analysis is based on Bayesian mixture model without p value. Such model would not use hypothesis testing and directly generate the posterior estimation of parameters. A posterior probability could be used to check whether certain peaks could be related to different condition. If we want to make comparison between classical model like LIMMA and Bayesian mixture model. We need to use simulation to find the cutoff. 9.3 PCA In most cases, PCA is used as an exploratory data analysis(EDA) method. In most of those most cases, PCA is just served as visualization method. I mean, when I need to visualize some high-dimension data, I would use PCA. So, the basic idea behind PCA is compression. When you have 100 samples with concentrations of certain compound, you could plot the concentrations with samples’ ID. However, if you have 100 compounds to be analyzed, it would by hard to show the relationship between the samples. Actually, you need to show a matrix with sample and compounds (100 * 100 with the concentrations filled into the matrix) in an informal way. The PCA would say: OK, guys, I could convert your data into only 100 * 2 matrix with the loss of information minimized. Yeah, that is what the mathematical guys or computer programmer do. You just run the command of PCA. The new two “compounds” might have the cor-relationship between the original 100 compounds and retain the variances between them. After such projection, you would see the compressed relationship between the 100 samples. If some samples’ data are similar, they would be projected together in new two “compounds” plot. That is why PCA could be used for cluster and the new “compounds” could be referred as principal components(PCs). However, you might ask why only two new compounds could finished such task. I have to say, two PCs are just good for visualization. In most cases, we need to collect PCs standing for more than 80% variances in our data if you want to recovery the data with PCs. If each compound have no relationship between each other, the PCs are still those 100 compounds. So you have found a property of the PCs: PCs are orthogonal between each other. Another issue is how to find the relationship between the compounds. We could use PCA to find the relationship between samples. However, we could also extract the influences of the compounds on certain PCs. You might find many compounds showed the same loading on the first PC. That means the concentrations pattern between the compounds are looked similar. So PCA could also be used to explore the relationship between the compounds. OK, next time you might recall PCA when you need it instead of other paper showed them. Besides, there are some other usage of PCA. Loadings are actually correlation coefficients between peaks and their PC scores. Yamamoto et.al.(yamamoto2014?) used t-test on this correlation coefficient and thought the peaks with statistically significant correlation to the PC score have biological meanings for further study such as annotation. However, such analysis works better when few PCs could explain most of the variances in the datasets. 9.4 Cluster Analysis After we got a lot of samples and analyzed the concentrations of many compounds in them, we may ask about the relationship between the samples. You might have the sampling information such as the date and the position and you could use boxplot or violin plot to explore the relationships among those categorical variables. However, you could also use the data to find some potential relationship. But how? if two samples’ data were almost the same, we might think those samples were from the same potential group. On the other hand, how do we define the “same” in the data? Cluster analysis told us that just define a “distances” to measure the similarity between samples. Mathematically, such distances would be shown in many different manners such as the sum of the absolute values of the differences between samples. For example, we analyzed the amounts of compound A, B and C in two samples and get the results: Compounds(ng) A B C Sample 1 10 13 21 Sample 2 54 23 16 The distance could be: \\[ distance = |10-54|+|13-23|+|21-16| = 59 \\] Also you could use the sum of squares or other way to stand for the similarity. After you defined a “distance,” you could get the distances between all of pairs for your samples. If two samples’ distance was the smallest, put them together as one group. Then calculate the distances again to combine the small group into big group until all of the samples were include in one group. Then draw a dendrogram for those process. The following issue is that how to cluster samples? You might set a cut-off and directly get the group from the dendrogram. However, sometimes you were ordered to cluster the samples into certain numbers of groups such as three. In such situation, you need K means cluster analysis. The basic idea behind the K means is that generate three virtual samples and calculate the distances between those three virtual samples and all of the other samples. There would be three values for each samples. Choose the smallest values and class that sample into this group. Then your samples were classified into three groups. You need to calculate the center of those three groups and get three new virtual samples. Repeat such process until the group members unchanged and you get your samples classified. OK, the basic idea behind the cluster analysis could be summarized as define the distances, set your cut-off and find the group. By this way, you might show potential relationships among samples. 9.5 PLSDA PLS-DA, OPLS-DA and HPSO-OPLS-DA(yang2017a?) could be used. Partial least squares discriminant analysis(PLSDA) was first used in the 1990s. However, Partial least squares(PLS) was proposed in the 1960s by Hermann Wold. Principal components analysis produces the weight matrix reflecting the covariance structure between the variables, while partial least squares produces the weight matrix reflecting the covariance structure between the variables and classes. After rotation by weight matrix, the new variables would contain relationship with classes. The classification performance of PLSDA is identical to linear discriminant analysis(LDA) if class sizes are balanced, or the columns are adjusted according to the mean of the class mean. If the number of variables exceeds the number of samples, LDA can be performed on the principal components. Quadratic discriminant analysis(QDA) could model nonlinearity relationship between variables while PLSDA is better for collinear variables. However, as a classifier, there is little advantage for PLSDA. The advantages of PLSDA is that this modle could show relationship between variables, which is not the goal of regular classifier. Different algorithms(andersson2009?) for PLSDA would show different score, while PCA always show the same score with fixed algorithm. For PCA, both new variables and classes are orthognal. However, for PLS(Wold), only new classes are orthognal. For PLS(Martens), only new variables are orthognal. This paper show the details of using such methods(brereton2018?). Sparse PLS discriminant analysis(sPLS-DA) make a L1 penal on the variable selection to remove the influnces from unrelated variables, which make sense for high-throughput omics data(lecao2011?). For o-PLS-DA, s-plot could be used to find features.(wiklund2008?) 9.6 Software MetaboAnalystR (chong2019?) caret could employ more than 200 statistical models in a general framework to build/select models.

I suggest anyone who want to be a data scientist to get familiar with platform like KNIME because they supplied various API for different programme language, which is easy to use and show every steps for others. Also TOPPView in OpenMS could be the best software to visualize the MS data. You could always use the metabolomics workflow to train starter about details in data processing. pyOpenMS and OpenSWATH are also used in this platform. If you want to turn into industry, this platform fit you best because you might get a clear idea about solution and workflow. 10.1.4 MZmine 2 MZmine 2 has three version developed on Java platform and the lastest version is included into MSDK. Similar function could be found from MZmine 2 as shown in XCMS online. However, MZmine 2 do not have pathway analysis. You could use metaboanalyst for that purpose. Actually, you could go into MSDK to find similar function supplied by ProteoSuite and Openchrom. If you are a experienced coder for Java, you should start here. 10.1.5 XCMS xcms is different from xcms online while they might share the same code. I used it almost every data to run local metabolomics data analysis. Recently, they will change their version to xcms 3 with major update for object class. Their data format would integrate into the MSnbase package and the parameters would be easy to set up for each step. Normally, I will use msconvert-IPO-xcms-xMSannotator-metaboanalyst as workflow to process the offline data. It could accelerate the process by parallel processing. However, if you are not familiar with R, you would better to choose some software above. 10.1.6 Emory MaHPIC This platform is composed by several R packages from Emory University including apLCMS to collect the data, xMSanalyzer to handle automated pipeline for large-scale, non-targeted metabolomics data, xMSannotator for annotation of LC-MS data and Mummichog for pathway and network analysis for high-throughput metabolomics. This platform would be preferred by someone from environmental science to study exposome. I always use xMSannotator to annotate the LC-MS data. 10.1.7 DIA data analysis Skyline is a freely-available and open source Windows client application for building Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) / Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM), Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM - Targeted MS/MS), Data Independent Acquisition (DIA/SWATH) and targeted DDA with MS1 quantitative methods and analyzing the resulting mass spectrometer data. MSstats is an R-based/Bioconductor package for statistical relative quantification of peptides and proteins in mass spectrometry-based proteomic experiments. It is applicable to multiple types of sample preparation, including label-free workflows, workflows that use stable isotope labeled reference proteins and peptides, and work-flows that use fractionation. It is applicable to targeted Selected Reactin Monitoring(SRM), Data-Dependent Acquisiton(DDA or shotgun), and Data-Independent Acquisition(DIA or SWATH-MS). This github page is for sharing source and testing. MS-DAIL is also an option for DIA. 10.1.8 Others MAVEN from Princeton University MAIT based on xcms and you could find source code here(fernandez-albert2014a?). metabolomics is a CRAN package for analysis of metabolomics data. LipidFinder A computational workflow for discovery of new lipid molecular species enviGCMS from environmental non-targeted analysis. pySM provides a reference implementation of our pipeline for False Discovery Rate-controlled metabolite annotation of high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry data. MetabolomeExpress a public place to process, interpret and share GC/MS metabolomics datasets. PhenoMeNal is an easy-to-use, cloud-based metabolomic research environment. MetAlign&amp;MSClust MetaboliteDetector is a QT4 based software package for the analysis of GC/MS based metabolomics data. autoGCMSDataAnal is a Matlab based comprehensive data analysis strategy for GC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics(zhang2020?). 10.2 Data sharing See this paper(haug2017?): MetaboLights EU based The Metabolomics Workbench US based MetabolomeXchange search engine W4M(guitton2017?) 10.3 Contest CASMI predict smail molecular contest 10.4 Project Setup I suggest building your data analysis projects in RStudio(Click File - New project - New dictionary - Empty project). Then assign a name for your project. I also recommend the following tips if you are familiar with it. Use git/github to make version control of your code and sync your project online. Don’t use your name for your project because other peoples might cooperate with you and someone might check your data when you publish your papers. Each project should be a work for one paper or one chapter in your thesis. Use workflow document(txt or doc) in your project to record all of the steps and code you performed for this project. Treat this document as digital version of your experiment notebook Use data folder in your project folder for the raw data and the results you get in data analysis Use figure folder in your project folder for the figure Use munuscript folder in your project folder for the manuscript (you could write paper in rstudio with the help of template in Rmarkdown) Just double click [yourprojectname].Rproj to start your project "],["exposome.html", "Chapter 11 Exposome 11.1 Internal exposure 11.2 External exposure", " Chapter 11 Exposome Nature or nurture debate has a similar paradigm in environmental study: is the ecological system and human health risk dominated by heredity or environment? Twins and siblings study(lakhani2019?; polderman2015?) show that both heritability and environmental factors could explain the phenotypic variance among population. The contribution of environment among different disease functional domain such as hematological and endocrine could achieve almost half of the total variances (polderman2015?). However, besides those epidemiology proof, little is known about the influences of overall environmental exposure process at molecular level. Conventional exposure study always investigate one or several specific compounds and their environmental fate or toxicology endpoint. Exposome, on the other hand, tries to access multiple exposure factors from biological or environmental samples as much as possible without a predefined compounds list. Those endogenous and exogenous molecules can reveal the exposure process in details. Exposome could not only help to investigate the comprehensive molecules level changes, but also the interactions among molecules in an non-targeted design. By following annotation of captured compounds, exposome can discover exposure markers for certain type of pollution, as well as biomarkers for certain exposure process and discuss related physiological process. According to CDC, The exposome can be defined as the measure of all the exposures of an individual in a lifetime and how those exposures relate to health. Exposomics is the study of the exposome and relies on the application of internal and external exposure assessment methods. Internal exposure relies on fields of study such as genomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. External exposure assessment relies on measuring environmental stressors. 11.1 Internal exposure HMDB is a freely available electronic database containing detailed information about small molecule metabolites found in the human body. Lipid Maps GMDB a multistage tandem mass spectral database using a variety of structurally defined glycans. KEGG is a collection of small molecules, biopolymers, and other chemical substances that are relevant to biological systems. Virtual Metabolic Human Database integrating human and gut microbiome metabolism with nutrition and disease. 11.2 External exposure 11.2.1 Environmental fate of compounds 11.2.1.1 QSPR Chemicalize is a powerful online platform for chemical calculations, search, and text processing. QSPR molecular descriptor generate tools list Spark uses computational algorithms based on fundamental chemical structure theory to estimate a wide variety of reactivity parameters strictly from molecular structure. OPERA OPERA models for predicting physicochemical properties and environmental fate endpoints(mansouri2018?). LogP is important for analytical chemistry. Mannhold (mannhold2009?) report a comprehensive comparison of logP algorithms. Later, Rajarshi Guha make a comparison with logP algorithms with CDK based on logPstar dataset. Commercial software such as Spark, ACS Labs and ChemAxon might always claim a better performance on in-house dataset compared with public software like KowWIN within EPI Suite. However, we should be careful to evaluate the influnce of logP accuracy on the metabolites or unknown compounds. 11.2.1.2 Fate Wania Group developed software tools to address various aspects of organic contaminant fate and behaviour. Trent University release models to predict environmental fate for pollutions such as Level 3. EAWAG-BBD could provide information on microbial enzyme-catalyzed reactions that are important for biotechnology. 11.2.2 Exposure study database The information system PANGAEA is operated as an Open Access library aimed at archiving, publishing and distributing georeferenced data from earth system research. Environmental Health Criteria (EHC) Monographs CTD is a robust, publicly available database that aims to advance understanding about how environmental exposures affect human health. ODMOA facilitates and coordinates the collection, access to, and use of public health data in order to monitor and improve population health. This data is better for general public health research for Massachusetts. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program provides information on cancer statistics in an effort to reduce the cancer burden among the U.S. population. CompTox compounds, exposure and toxicity database. Here is related data. T3DB is a unique bioinformatics resource that combines detailed toxin data with comprehensive toxin target information.
