Following such stream, we might answer certain problems in different scales from individual, population, community to ecosystem. Metabolomics (i.e., the profiling and quantitation of metabolites in body fluids) is a relatively new field of “omics” studies. Different from other omics studies, metabolomics always focused on small moleculars with much lower mass than polypeptide with single or doubled charged ions. Here is a demo of the position of metabolomics in “omics” studies(B. Dunn et al. 2011). Figure 1.1: The complex interactions of functional levels in biological systems. Metabolomics studies are always performed in GC-MS(Theodoridis et al. 2012), GC*GC-MS(Tian et al. 2016), LC-MS(Gika et al. 2014), LC-MS/MS(Begou et al. 2017) or NMR(Zhang et al. 2012; B. Dunn et al. 2011). This workflow would only cover mass spectrometry based metabolomics or XC-MS based research. 1.1 History 1.1.1 History of Mass Spectrometry 1913, Sir Joseph John Thomson “Rays of Positive Electricity and Their Application to Chemical Analyses.” Figure 1.2: Sir Joseph John Thomson “Rays of Positive Electricity and Their Application to Chemical Analyses.” Petroleum industry bring mass spectrometry from physics to chemistry The first commercial mass spectrometer is from Consolidated Engineering Corp to analysis simple gas mixtures from petroleum In World War II, U.S. use mass spectrometer to separate and enrich isotopes of uranium in Manhattan Project U.S. also use mass spectrometer for organic compounds during wartime and extend the application of mass spectrometer 1946, TOF, William E.

Metabolic fingerprinting is working on fast classification of samples based on metabolite data without quantifying or identification of the metabolites. Metabolite profiling always need a pre-defined metabolites to be quantification.(Madsen, Lundstedt, and Trygg 2010) 1.2 Reviews and tutorials Some nice reviews and tutorials related to this workflow could be found in those papers or directly online: 1.2.1 Workflow Those papers are recommended(Barnes et al. 2016a; Cajka and Fiehn 2016; X.

["exprimental-designdoe.html", "Chapter 2 Exprimental design(DoE) 2.1 Software", " Chapter 2 Exprimental design(DoE) Before you perform any metabolomic studies, a clean and meaningful experimental design is the best start. You need at least two groups: treated group and control group. Also you could treat this group infomation as the one primary variable or primary variables to be explored for certain research purposes. The numbers of samples in each group should be carefully calculated. Supposing the metaoblites of certain biological process only have a few metabolites, the first goal of the exprimenal design is to find the differences of each metabolite in different group. For each metabolite, such comparision could be treated as one t-test. You need to perform a Power analysis to get the numbers. For example, we have two groups of samples with 10 samples in each group. Then we set the power at 0.9, which means 1 minus Type II error probability, the standard deviation at 1 and the significance level(Type 1 error probability) at 0.05. Then we get the meanful delta between the two groups should be higher than 1.53367 under this experiment design. Also we could set the delta to get the minimized numbers of the samples in each group. To get those data such as the standard deviation or delta for power analysis, you need to perform pre-experiments. power.t.test(n=10,sd=1,sig.level = 0.05,power = 0.9) ## ## Two-sample t test power calculation ## ## n = 10 ## delta = 1.53367 ## sd = 1 ## sig.level = 0.05 ## power = 0.9 ## alternative = two.sided ## ## NOTE: n is number in *each* group power.t.test(delta = 5,sd=1,sig.level = 0.05,power = 0.9) ## ## Two-sample t test power calculation ## ## n = 2.328877 ## delta = 5 ## sd = 1 ## sig.level = 0.05 ## power = 0.9 ## alternative = two.sided ## ## NOTE: n is number in *each* group However, since sometimes we could not perform prelimintery experiment, we could directly compute the power based on false discovery rate control. If the power is lower than certain value, say 0.8, we just exclude this peak as significant features. Other study Blaise et al. (2016) show a method based on simulation to estimate the sample size. They usd BY correction to limit the influnces from correlationship. However, the nature of omics study make the power analysis hard to use one numbers and all the methods are trying to find a balance to represent more peaks with least samples(save money). If there are other co-factors, a linear model or randomizing would be applied to eliminated their influences. You need to record the values of those co-factors for further data analysis. Common co-factors in metabolomic studies are age, gender, location, etc. If you need data correction, some background or calibration samples are required. However, control samples could also be used for data correction in certain DoE. Another important factors are instrumentals. High-resolution mass spectrum is always preferred. As shown in Lukas’s study Najdekr et al. (2016): the most effective mass resolving powers for profiling analyses of metabolite rich biofluids on the Orbitrap Elite were around 60000–120000 fwhm to retrieve the highest amount of information. The region between 400–800 m/z was influenced the most by resolution. However, elimination of peaks with high RSD% within group were always omited by most study. Based on pre-experiment, you could get a description of RSD% distribution and set cut-off to use stable peaks for further data analysis. To my knowledge, 50% is suitable considering the batch effects. 2.1 Software MetSizeR GUI Tool for Estimating Sample Sizes for Metabolomic Experiments. References "],
["pretreatment.html", "Chapter 3 Pretreatment 3.1 Quenching 3.2 Extraction", " Chapter 3 Pretreatment Pretreatment will affect the results of metabolomics. For example, feces collected with 95% ethanol or FOBT would be more reproducible and stable. Dmitri et.al(Sitnikov, Monnin, and Vuckovic 2016) thought the most orthogonal methods to methanol-based precipitation were ion-exchange solid-phase extraction and liquid-liquid extraction using methyl-tertbutyl ether. 3.1 Quenching Quenching solvent is always used to stop stop enzymatic activity. In this review(Lu et al. 2017), authors said: A classical approach, which works well for many analytes, is boiling ethanol. Although the boiling solvent raises concerns about thermal degradation, it reliably denatures enzymes. In contrast, cold organic solvent may not fully denature enzymes or may do so too slowly such that some metabolic reactions continue, interconverting metabolites during the quenching process. 3.2 Extraction According to this research(Bennett et al. 2009): The total metabolome concentration is approximately 300 mM, whereas the protein concentration is approximately 7 mM., which implies that most cellular metabolites are in free form. Tissue samples need to first be pulverized into fine powders In this review(Lu et al. 2017), authors said: In our experience, for both cell and tissue specimens, 40:40:20 acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid (and subsequent neutralization with ammonium bicarbonate) is generally an effective solvent system for both quenching and extraction, including for ATP and other high-energy phosphorylated compounds. We typically use approximately 1 mL of solvent mix to extract 25 mg of biological specimen. …Thus, although drying is acceptable for most metabolites, care must be taken with redox-active species.

["instrumental-analysis.html", "Chapter 4 Instrumental analysis", " Chapter 4 Instrumental analysis To get more infomation in the samples, full scan is perferred on GC/LC-MS. Each scan would generat a mass spectrum to cover the setting mass range. If you narrow down your mass range and keep the same scan time, each mass would gain the collection time and you would get a higher sensitivity. However, if you expand your scan range, the sensitivity for each mass would decrease. You could also extend the collection time for each scan. However, it would affect the seperation process. Full scan is performed synchronously with the seperation process. For a better seperation on chromotograph, each peak should have at least 10 point to get a nice peak shape. If you want to seperate two peaks with a retention time differences of 10s. Assuming the half peak width is 5s, you need to collect 10 mass spectrum within 10s. So the drwell time for each scan is 1s. If you use a high resolution column and the half peak width is 1s, you need to finish a scan within 0.2s. As we talked above, shorter drwell time would decrease the sensitivity. Thus there is a trade-off between seperation and sensitivity. If you use UPLC, the seperation could be finished within 20 min while you need to calculate if you mass spectrumetry could still show a good sensitivity. "],
["raw-data-pretreatment.html", "Chapter 5 Raw data pretreatment 5.1 Peak extraction 5.2 Retention Time Correction 5.3 Filling missing values 5.4 Spectral deconvolution 5.5 Dynamic Range 5.6 Software", " Chapter 5 Raw data pretreatment Raw data from the instruments such as LC-MS or GC-MS were hard to be analyzed. To make it clear, the structure of those data could be summarised as: Indexed scan with time-stamp Each scan contain a full scan mass spetrum with intensities 5.1 Peak extraction GC/LC-MS data are usually be shown as a matrix with column standing for retention times and row standing for masses after bin them into small cell. Figure 5.1: Demo of GC/LC-MS data Conversation from the mass-retention time matrix into a vector with selected MS peaks at certain retention time is the basic idea of Peak extraction. You could EIC for each mass to charge ratio and use the change of trace slope to determine whether there is a peak or not. Then we could make integration for this peak and get peak area and retention time. intensity &lt;- c(10,10,10,10,10,14,19,25,30,33,26,21,16,12,11,10,9,10,11,10) time &lt;- c(1:20) plot(intensity~time, type = &#39;o&#39;, main = &#39;EIC&#39;) Figure 5.2: Demo of EIC with peak However, in mass spectrumetry dataset, the EIC is not that simple for full scan. Due to the accuracy of instrument, the detected mass to charge ratio would have some shift and EIC would fail if different scan get the intensity from different mass to charge ratio. In the matchedfilter algorithm(Smith et al. 2006), they solve this issue by bin the data in m/z dimension. The adjacent chromatographic slices could be combined to find a clean signal fitting fixed second-derivative Gaussian with full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of 30s to find peaks with about 1.5-4 times the signal peak width. The the integration is performed on the fitted area. Figure 5.3: Demo of matchedfilter The Centwave algorithm(Tautenhahn, Böttcher, and Neumann 2008) based on detection of regions of interest(ROI) and the following Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is preferred for high-resolution mass spectrum. ROI means a regine with stable mass for a certain time. When we find the ROIs, the peak shape is evaluated and ROI could be extended if needed. This algotithm use prefilter to accelerate the processing speed. prefilter with 3 and 100 means the ROI should contain 3 scan with intensity above 100. Centwave use a peak width range which should be checked on pool QC. Another important parameter is ppm. It is the maximum allowed deviation between scans when locating regions of interest (ROIs), which is different from vendor number and you need to extend them larger than the company claimed. For profparam, it’s used for fill peaks or align peaks instead of peak picking. snthr is the cutoff of signal to noise ratio. 5.2 Retention Time Correction For single file, we could get peaks. However, we should make the peaks align across samples for subsquece analysis and retention time corrections should be performed. The basic idea behind retention time correction is that use the high quality grouped peaks to make a new retention time. You might choose obiwarp(for dramatic shifts) or loess regression(fast) method to get the corrected retention time for all of the samples. Remember the original retention times might be changed and you might need cross-correct the data. After the correction, you could group the peaks again for a better cross-sample peaks list. However, if you directly use obiwarp, you don’t have to group peaks before correction. (Fu et al. 2017) show a matlab based shift correction methods 5.3 Filling missing values Too many zeros in peaks list are problematic for statistics. Then we usually need to integreate the area exsiting a peak. xcms 3 could use profile matrix instead of profil matrix, which limited the range. With many groups of samples, you will get another data matrix with column standing for peaks at cerntain retention time and row standing for samples after the Raw data pretreatment. Figure 5.4: Demo of many GC/LC-MS data 5.4 Spectral deconvolution Without fracmental infomation about certain compound, the peak extraction would suffer influnces from other compounds. At the same retention time, co-elute compounds might share similar mass. Hard electron ionization methods such as electron impact ionization (EI), APPI suffer this issue. So it would be hard to distighuish the co-elute peaks’ origin and deconvolution method(Du and Zeisel 2013) could be used to seperate different groups according to the similar chromatogragh beheviors. Another computational tool eRah could be a better solution for the whole process(Domingo-Almenara et al. 2016). Also the ADAD-GC3.0 could also be helpful for such issue(Ni et al. 2016). 5.5 Dynamic Range Another issue is the Dynamic Range. For metabolomics, peaks could be below the detection limit or over the detection limit. Such Dynamic range issues might raise the loss of information. 5.5.1 Non-detects Some of the data were limited by the detect of limitation. Thus we need some methods to impute the data if we don’t want to lose information by deleting the NA or 0. Two major imputation way could be used. The first way is use model-free method such as half the minimum of the values across the data, 0, 1, mean/median across the data( enviGCMS package could do this via getimputation function). The second way is use model-based method such as linear model, random forest, KNN, PCA. Try simputation package for various imputation methods. Tobit regression is preferred for censored data. Also you might choose maximum likelihood estimation(Estimation of mean and standard deviation by MLE. Creating 10 complete samples.

See Exprimental design(DoE) 6.3 Power Analysis Filter As shown in Exprimental design(DoE), the power analysis in metabolomics is ad-hoc since you don’t know too much before you perform the experiment. However, we could perform power analysis after the experiment done. That is, we just rule out the peaks with a lower power in exsit Exprimental design. 6.4 Normalization Variances among the samples across all the extracted peaks might be affected by factors other than the experiment design. To make the samples comparable, normailization across the samples are always needed. There are more than 20 methods to make normalization. We could devided those methods into two category: unsupervised and supervised. Unsupervised methods only consider the normalization peaks intensity distribution across the samples. For example, quantile calibration try to make the intensity distribution among the samples similar. Such methods are preferred to explore the inner structures of the samples. Internal standards or pool QC samples also belong to this category. However, it’s hard to take a few peaks standing for all peaks extracted. Supervised methods will use the group information or batch information in experimental design to normalize the data. A linear model is always used to model the unwanted variances and remove them for further analysis. Since the real batch effects are always unknown, it’s hard to make validation for different normalization methods. Wu et.al preferred to make comparision between new methods and conventional methods(Wu and Li 2016). Li et.al developed NOREVA to make comparision among 25 correction method(Li et al. 2017). Another idea is use spiked-in samples to validate the methods(Franceschi et al. 2012), which might be good for targeted analysis instead of non-targeted analysis. Relative log abundance (RLA) plots(De Livera et al. 2012) and heatmap often used to show the variances among the samples. (Thonusin et al. 2017) some methods for batch correction in excel 6.4.1 Unsupervised methods 6.4.1.1 Distribution of intensity Intensity collects from LC/GC-MS always showed a right-skewed distribution. Log transformation is often necessary for further statistical analysis. In some case, a Log-transformated intensity could be visulizated easily. 6.4.1.2 Centering For peak p of sample s in batch b, the corrected abundance I is: \\[\\hat I_{p,s,b} = I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b}) + median(I_{p,qc})\\] For example, we have the intensities of one peak from ten samples in two batches like the following demo: set.seed(42) # raw data I = c(rnorm(10,mean = 0, sd = 0.5),rnorm(10,mean = 1, sd = 0.5)) # batch B = c(rep(0,10),rep(1,10)) # qc Iqc = c(rnorm(1,mean = 0, sd = 0.5),rnorm(1,mean = 1, sd = 0.5)) # corrected data Icor = I - c(rep(mean(I[1:10]),10),rep(mean(I[11:20]),10)) + median(Iqc) # plot the result plot(I) plot(Icor) 6.4.1.3 Scaling For peak p of sample s in certain batch b, the corrected abundance I is: \\[\\hat I_{p,s,b} = \\frac{I_{p,s,b} - mean(I_{p,b})}{std_{p,b}} * std_{p,qc,b} + mean(I_{p,qc,b})\\] For example, we have the intensities of one peak from ten samples in two batches like the following demo: set.seed(42) # raw data I = c(rnorm(10,mean = 0, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 1, sd = 0.5)) # batch B = c(rep(0,10),rep(1,10)) # qc Iqc = c(rnorm(1,mean = 0, sd = 0.3),rnorm(1,mean = 1, sd = 0.5)) # corrected data Icor = (I - c(rep(mean(I[1:10]),10),rep(mean(I[11:20]),10)))/c(sd(I[1:10]),sd(I[11:20]))*c(rep(0.3,10),rep(0.5,10)) + Iqc[1] # plot the result plot(I) plot(Icor) 6.4.1.4 Quantile The idea of quantile calibration is that alignment of the intensities in certain samples according to quantiles in each sample. Here is the demo: set.seed(42) a &lt;- rnorm(1000) # b sufferred batch effect with a bias of 10 b &lt;- rnorm(1000,10) hist(a,xlim=c(-5,15),breaks = 50) hist(b,col = &#39;black&#39;, breaks = 50, add=T) # quantile normalized cor &lt;- (a[order(a)]+b[order(b)])/2 # reorder cor &lt;- cor[order(order(a))] hist(cor,col = &#39;red&#39;, breaks = 50, add=T) 6.4.1.5 Ratio based calibraton This method calibrates samples by the ratio between qc samples in all samples and in certain batch.For peak p of sample s in certain batch b, the corrected abundance I is: \\[\\hat I_{p,s,b} = \\frac{I_{p,s,b} * median(I_{p,qc})}{mean_{p,qc,b}}\\] set.seed(42) # raw data I = c(rnorm(10,mean = 0, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 1, sd = 0.5)) # batch B = c(rep(0,10),rep(1,10)) # qc Iqc = c(rnorm(1,mean = 0, sd = 0.3),rnorm(1,mean = 1, sd = 0.5)) # corrected data Icor = I * median(c(rep(Iqc[1],10),rep(Iqc[2],10)))/mean(c(rep(Iqc[1],10),rep(Iqc[2],10))) # plot the result plot(I) plot(Icor) 6.4.1.6 Linear Normalizer This method initially scales each sample so that the sum of all peak abundances equals one. In this study, by multiplying the median sum of all peak abundances across all samples,we got the corrected data. set.seed(42) # raw data peaksa &lt;- c(rnorm(10,mean = 10, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 20, sd = 0.5)) peaksb &lt;- c(rnorm(10,mean = 10, sd = 0.3),rnorm(10,mean = 20, sd = 0.5)) df &lt;- rbind(peaksa,peaksb) dfcor &lt;- df/apply(df,2,sum)* sum(apply(df,2,median)) image(df) image(dfcor) 6.4.1.7 Internal standards \\[\\hat I_{p,s} = \\frac{I_{p,s} * median(I_{IS})}{I_{IS,s}}\\] Some methods also use pooled calibration samples and multiple internal standard strategy to correct the data(???). Also some methods only use QC samples to handle the data(Kuligowski et al. 2015). 6.4.2 Supervised methods 6.4.2.1 Regression calibration Considering the batch effect of injection order, regress the data by a linear model to get the calibration. 6.4.2.2 Batch Normalizer Use the total abundance scale and then fit with the regression line(Wang, Kuo, and Tseng 2013). 6.4.2.3 Surrogate Variable Analysis(SVA) We have a data matrix(M*N) with M stands for indentity peaks from one sample and N stand for individual samples. For one sample, \\(X = (x_{i1},...,x_{in})^T\\) stands for the normalized intensities of peaks. We use \\(Y = (y_i,...,y_m)^T\\) stands for the group infomation of our data. Then we could build such modles: \\[x_{ij} = \\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + e_{ij}\\] \\(\\mu_i\\) stands for the baseline of the peak intensities in a normal state. Then we have: \\[f_i(y_i) = E(x_{ij}|y_j) - \\mu_i\\] stands for the biological variations caused by the our group, for example, whether treated by pollutions or not. However, considering the batch effects, the real model could be: \\[x_{ij} = \\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \\sum_{l = 1}^L \\gamma_{li}p_{lj} + e_{ij}^*\\] \\(\\gamma_{li}\\) stands for the peak-specific coefficient for potentical factor \\(l\\). \\(p_{lj}\\) stands for the potential factors across the samples. Actually, the error item \\(e_{ij}\\) in real sample could always be decomposed as \\(e_{ij} = \\sum_{l = 1}^L \\gamma_{li}p_{lj} + e_{ij}^*\\) with \\(e_{ij}^*\\) standing for the real random error in certain sample for certain peak. We could not get the potential factors directly. Since we don’t care the details of the unknown factors, we could estimate orthogonal vectors \\(h_k\\) standing for such potential factors. Thus we have: \\[ x_{ij} = \\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \\sum_{l = 1}^L \\gamma_{li}p_{lj} + e_{ij}^*\\\\ = \\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \\sum_{k = 1}^K \\lambda_{ki}h_{kj} + e_{ij} \\] Here is the details of the algorithm: The algorithm is decomposed into two parts: detection of unmodeled factors and construction of surrogate variables 6.4.2.3.1 Detection of unmodeled factors Estimate \\(\\hat\\mu_i\\) and \\(f_i\\) by fitting the model \\(x_{ij} = \\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + e_{ij}\\) and get the residual \\(r_{ij} = x_{ij}-\\hat\\mu_i - \\hat f_i(y_i)\\). Then we have the residual matrix R. Perform the singular value decompositon(SVD) of the residual matrix \\(R = UDV^T\\) Let \\(d_l\\) be the \\(l\\)th eigenvalue of the diagonal matrix D for \\(l = 1,...,n\\). Set \\(df\\) as the freedom of the model \\(\\hat\\mu_i + \\hat f_i(y_i)\\). We could build a statistic \\(T_k\\) as: \\[T_k = \\frac{d_k^2}{\\sum_{l=1}^{n-df}d_l^2}\\] to show the variance explained by the \\(k\\)th eigenvalue. Permute each row of R to remove the structure in the matrix and get \\(R^*\\). Fit the model \\(r_{ij}^* = \\mu_i^* + f_i^*(y_i) + e^*_{ij}\\) and get \\(r_{ij}^0 = r^*_{ij}-\\hat\\mu^*_i - \\hat f^*_i(y_i)\\) as a null matrix \\(R_0\\) Perform the singular value decompositon(SVD) of the residual matrix \\(R_0 = U_0D_0V_0^T\\) Compute the null statistic: \\[ T_k^0 = \\frac{d_{0k}^2}{\\sum_{l=1}^{n-df}d_{0l}^2} \\] Repeat permuting the row B times to get the null statistics \\(T_k^{0b}\\) Get the p-value for eigengene: \\[p_k = \\frac{\\#{T_k^{0b}\\geq T_k;b=1,...,B }}{B}\\] For a significance level \\(\\alpha\\), treat k as a significant signature of residual R if \\(p_k\\leq\\alpha\\) 6.4.2.3.2 Construction of surrogate variables Estimate \\(\\hat\\mu_i\\) and \\(f_i\\) by fitting the model \\(x_{ij} = \\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + e_{ij}\\) and get the residual \\(r_{ij} = x_{ij}-\\hat\\mu_i - \\hat f_i(y_i)\\). Then we have the residual matrix R. Perform the singular value decompositon(SVD) of the residual matrix \\(R = UDV^T\\). Let \\(e_k = (e_{k1},...,e_{kn})^T\\) be the \\(k\\)th column of V Set \\(\\hat K\\) as the significant eigenvalues found by the first step. Regress each \\(e_k\\) on \\(x_i\\), get the p-value for the association. Set \\(\\pi_0\\) as the proportion of the peak intensitity \\(x_i\\) not associate with \\(e_k\\) and find the numbers \\(\\hat m =[1-\\hat \\pi_0 \\times m]\\) and the indices of the peaks associated with the eigenvalues Form the matrix \\(\\hat m_1 \\times N\\), this matrix\\(X_r\\) stand for the potiential variables. As was done for R, get the eigengents of \\(X_r\\) and denote these by \\(e_j^r\\) Let \\(j^* = argmax_{1\\leq j \\leq n}cor(e_k,e_j^r)\\) and set \\(\\hat h_k=e_j^r\\). Set the estimate of the surrogate variable to be the eigenvalue of the reduced matrix most correlated with the corresponding residual eigenvalue. Since the reduced matrix is enriched for peaks associated with this residual eigenvalue, this is a principled choice for the estimated surrogate variable that allows for correlation with the primary variable. Employ the \\(\\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \\sum_{k = 1}^K \\gamma_{ki}\\hat h_{kj} + e_{ij}\\) as te estimate of the ideal model \\(\\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \\sum_{k = 1}^K \\gamma_{ki}h_{kj} + e_{ij}\\) This method could found the potentical unwanted variables for the data. SVA were introduced by Jeff Leek(Leek et al. 2012; Leek and Storey 2007, 2008) and EigenMS package implement SVA with modifications including analysis of data with missing values that are typical in LC-MS experiments(Karpievitch et al. 2014). 6.4.2.4 RUV (Remove Unwanted Variation) This method’s performance is similar to SVA. Instead find surrogate variable from the whole dataset. RUA use control or pool QC to find the unwanted variances and remove them to find the peaks related to experimental design. However, we could also empirically estimate the control peaks by linear mixed model. RUA-random(Livera et al. 2015) furthor use linear mixed model to estimate the variances of random error. This method could be used with suitable control, which is commen in metabolomics DoE. 6.4.2.5 RRmix RRmix also use a latent factor models correct the data(Jr et al. 2017). This method could be treated as linear mixed model version SVA. No control samples are required and the unwanted variances could be removed by factor analysis. This method might be the best choise to remove the unwanted variables with commen experiment design. 6.5 Software BatchCorrMetabolomics is for improved batch correction in untargeted MS-based metabolomics MetNorm show Statistical Methods for Normalizing Metabolomics Data.

Check this review(Domingo-Almenara et al. 2018) for a detailed notes on annotation. They proposed five levels regarding currently computational annotation strategies. Level 1: Peak Grouping: MS Psedospectra extraction based on peak shape similarity and peak abundance correlation Level 2: Peak Annotation: Adducts, Neutral losses, isotopes, and other mass relationships based on mass distances Level 3: Biochemical knowledge based on putative identification, potential biochemical reaction and related statistical analysis Level 4: Use and intergration of tandem MS data based on data dependant/independent acquistion mode or in silico predction Level 5: Retention time prediction based on library-available retention index or quantitative structure-retnetion relationships (QSRR) models. Most of the softwares are at level 1 or 2. If we only have compounds structure, we could guess ions under different ionization method. If we have mass spectrum, we could match the mass spectral by a similarity analysis to the database. In metabolomics, we only have mass spectrum or mass-to-charge ratios. Single mass-to-charge ratio is not enough for identification. That’s the one bottleneck for annotation. So prediction is always performed on MS/MS data. 7.1 Issues in annotation The major issue in annotation is the redundancy peaks from same metabolite. Unlike genomcis, peaks or featuers from peak selection are not independant with each other. Adducts, in-source fragments and isotopes would lead to missannotation. A commen solution is that use known adducts, neutral losses, molecular multimers or multipley charged ions to compare mass distances. Another issue is about the MS/MS database. Only 10% of known metabolites in databases have experimental spectral data. Thus in silico prediction are required. Some works try to fill the gap between experimental data, theoretical values(from chemical database like chemspider) and prediction together. Here is a nice review about MS/MS prediction(Hufsky, Scheubert, and Böcker 2014). 7.2 Annotation v.s. identification According to the defination from the Chemical Analysis Working Group of the Metabolomics Standards Intitvative(Sumner et al. 2007; Viant et al. 2017). Four levels of confidence could be assigned to identification: Level 1 ‘identified metabolites’ Level 2 ‘Putatively annotated compounds’ Level 3 ‘Putatively characterised compound classes’ Level 4 ‘Unknown’ In practice, data analysis based annotation could reach level 2. For level 1, we need at extra methods such as MS/MS, retention time, accurate mass, 2D NMR spectra, and so on to confirm the compounds. However, standards are always required for solid proof. 7.3 MS Database for annotation 7.3.1 MS/MS MoNA Platform to collect all other open source database MassBank GNPS use inner correlationship in the data and make network analysis at peaks’ level instand of annotated compounds to annotate the data(Wang et al. 2016).

However, since metabolomics are usually performed in a non-targeted mode, statistical analysis methods are always started with the exploratory analysis. The basic target for an exploratory analysis is: Find the relationship among variables Find the relationship among samples/group of samples. This is basically unsurpvised analysis. However, sometimes we have group information which could be used to find biomarkers or correlationship between variables and groups or continous variables. This type of data need supervised methods to process. Before we talk the details of algorithms, let’s cover some basic statistical concepts. 9.1 Basic Statistical Analysis Statistic is used to describe certain property or variables among the samples. It could be designed for certain purpose to extract signal and remove noise. Statistical models and inference are both based on statistic instead of the data. \\[Statistic = f(sample_1,sample_2,...,sample_n)\\] Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) is often used to make statistical inference. P value is the probability of certain statistics happens under H0 (pre-defined distribution). For omics studies, you should realise Multiple Comparision issue when you perform a lot of(more than 20) comparisions or tests at the same time. False Discovery Rate(FDR) control is required for multiple tests to make sure the results are not false positive. You could use Benjamini-Hochberg method to adjust raw p values or directly use Storey Q value to make FDR control. NHST is famous for the failure of p-value interpretation as well as multiple comparision issues. Bayesian Hypothesis Testing could be an options to cover some drawbacks of NHST. Bayesian Hypothesis Testing use Bayes factor to show the differences between null hypothesis and any other hypothesis. \\[Bayes\\ factor = \\frac{p(D|Ha)}{p(D|H0)} = \\frac{posterior\\ odds}{prior\\ odds}\\] Statistical model use statistics to make prediction/explanation. Most of the statistical model need to be tuned for parpameters to show a better performance. Statistical model is build on real data and could be diagnosed by other general statistics such as \\(R^2\\), \\(ROC curve\\). When the models are built or compared, model selection could be preformed. \\[Target = g(Statistic) = g(f(sample_1,sample_2,...,sample_n))\\] Bias-Variance Tradeoff is an important concept regarding statistical models. Certain models could be overfitted(small Bias, large variance) or underfitted(large Bias, small variance) when the parameters of models are not well selected. \\[E[(y - \\hat f)^2] = \\sigma^2 + Var[\\hat f] + Bias[\\hat f]\\] Cross validation could be used to find the best model based on training-testing strategy such as Jacknife, bootstraping resampling and n-fold cross validation. Regularization for models could also be used to find the model with best prediction performance. Rigid regression, LASSO or other general regularization could be employed to build a robust models. For supervised models, linear model and tree based model are two basic categories. Linear model could be useful to tell the independant or correlated relationship of variables and the influnces on the predicted variables. Tree based model, on the other hand, try to build a hierarchical structure for the variables such as bagging, random forest or boosting. Linear model could be treated as special case of tree based model with single layer. Other models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or Deep Learning are also make various assumptions on the data. However, if you final target is prediction, you could try any of those models or even weighted combine their prediciton to make meta-prediction. 9.2 Differences analysis After we get corrected peaks across samples, the next step is to find the differences between two groups. Actually, you could perform ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis Test for comparison among more than two groups. The basic idea behind statistic analysis is to find the meaningful differences between groups and extract such ions or peak groups. So how to find the differences? In most metabolomics software, such task is completed by a t-test and report p-value and fold changes. If you only compare two groups on one peaks, that’s OK. However, if you compare two groups on thousands of peaks, statistic textbook would tell you to notice the false positive. For one comparasion, the confidence level is 0.05, which means 5% chances to get false positive result. For two comparasions, such chances would be \\(1-0.95^2\\). For 10 comparasions, such chances would be \\(1-0.95^{10} = 0.4012631\\). For 100 comparasions, such chances would be \\(1-0.95^{100} = 0.9940795\\). You would almost certainly to make mistakes for your results. In statistics, the false discovery rate(FDR) control is always mentioned in omics studies for mutiple tests. I suggested using q-values to control FDR. If q-value is less than 0.05, we should expect a lower than 5% chances we make the wrong selections for all of the comparisions showed lower q-values in the whole dataset. Also we could use local false discovery rate, which showed the FDR for certain peaks. However, such values are hard to be estimated accurately. Karin Ortmayr thought fold change might be better than p-values to find the differences(Ortmayr et al. 2016). 9.3 PCA In most cases, PCA is used as an exploratory data analysis(EDA) method. In most of those most cases, PCA is just served as visualization method. I mean, when I need to visualize some high-dimension data, I would use PCA. So, the basic idea behind PCA is compression. When you have 100 samples with concentrations of certain compound, you could plot the concentrations with samples’ ID. However, if you have 100 compounds to be analyzed, it would by hard to show the relationship between the samples. Actually, you need to show a matrix with sample and compounds (100 * 100 with the concentrations filled into the matrix) in an informal way. The PCA would say: OK, guys, I could convert your data into only 100 * 2 matrix with the loss of information minimized. Yeah, that is what the mathematical guys or computer programmer do. You just run the command of PCA. The new two “compounds” might have the cor-relationship between the original 100 compounds and retain the variances between them. After such projection, you would see the compressed relationship between the 100 samples. If some samples’ data are similar, they would be projected together in new two “compounds” plot. That is why PCA could be used for cluster and the new “compounds” could be referred as principal components(PCs). However, you might ask why only two new compounds could finished such task. I have to say, two PCs are just good for visualization. In most cases, we need to collect PCs standing for more than 80% variances in our data if you want to recovery the data with PCs. If each compound have no relationship between each other, the PCs are still those 100 compounds. So you have found a property of the PCs: PCs are orthogonal between each other. Another issue is how to find the relationship between the compounds. We could use PCA to find the relationship between samples. However, we could also extract the influences of the compounds on certain PCs. You might find many compounds showed the same loading on the first PC. That means the concentrations pattern between the compounds are looked similar. So PCA could also be used to explore the relationship between the compounds. OK, next time you might recall PCA when you need it instead of other paper showed them. Besides, there are some other usage of PCA. Loadings are actually correlation coefficients between peaks and their PC scores. Yamamoto et.al.(Yamamoto et al. 2014) used t-test on this correlation coefficient and thought the peaks with statistically significant correlation to the PC score have biological meanings for further study such as annotation. However, such analysis works better when few PCs could explain most of the variances in the datasets. 9.4 Cluster Analysis After we got a lot of samples and analyzed the concentrations of many compounds in them, we may ask about the relationship between the samples. You might have the sampling information such as the date and the position and you could use boxplot or violin plot to explore the relationships among those categorical variables. However, you could also use the data to find some potential relationship. But how? if two samples’ data were almost the same, we might think those samples were from the same potential group. On the other hand, how do we define the “same” in the data? Cluster analysis told us that just define a “distances” to measure the similarity between samples. Mathematically, such distances would be shown in many different manners such as the sum of the absolute values of the differences between samples. For example, we analyzed the amounts of compound A, B and C in two samples and get the results: Compounds(ng) A B C Sample 1 10 13 21 Sample 2 54 23 16 The distance could be: \\[ distance = |10-54|+|13-23|+|21-16| = 59 \\] Also you could use the sum of squares or other way to stand for the similarity. After you defined a “distance”, you could get the distances between all of pairs for your samples. If two samples’ distance was the smallest, put them together as one group. Then calculate the distances again to combine the small group into big group until all of the samples were include in one group. Then draw a dendrogram for those process. The following issue is that how to cluster samples? You might set a cut-off and directly get the group from the dendrogram. However, sometimes you were ordered to cluster the samples into certain numbers of groups such as three. In such situation, you need K means cluster analysis. The basic idea behind the K means is that generate three virtual samples and calculate the distances between those three virtual samples and all of the other samples. There would be three values for each samples. Choose the smallest values and class that sample into this group. Then your samples were classified into three groups. You need to calculate the center of those three groups and get three new virtual samples. Repeat such process until the group members unchanged and you get your samples classified. OK, the basic idea behind the cluster analysis could be summarized as define the distances, set your cut-off and find the group. By this way, you might show potential relationships among samples. 9.5 PLSDA PLS-DA, OPLS-DA and HPSO-OPLS-DA(Yang et al. 2017) could be used. Partial least squares discriminant analysis(PLSDA) was first used in the 1990s. However, Partial least squares(PLS) was proposed in the 1960s by Hermann Wold. Principal components analysis produces the weight matrix reflecting the covariance structure between the variables, while partial least squares produces the weight matrix reflecting the covariance structure between the variables and classes. After rotation by weight matrix, the new variables would contain relationship with classes. The classification performance of PLSDA is identical to linear discriminant analysis(LDA) if class sizes are balanced, or the columns are adjusted according to the mean of the class mean. If the number of variables exceeds the number of samples, LDA can be performed on the principal components. Quadratic discriminant analysis(QDA) could model nonlinearity relationship between variables while PLSDA is better for collinear variables. However, as a classifier, there is little advantage for PLSDA. The advantages of PLSDA is that this modle could show relationship between variables, which is not the goal of regular classifier. Different algorithms(Andersson 2009) for PLSDA would show different score, while PCA always show the same score with fixed algorithm. For PCA, both new variables and classes are orthognal. However, for PLS(Wold), only new classes are orthognal. For PLS(Martens), only new variables are orthognal. This paper show the details of using such methods(Brereton and Lloyd 2018). Sparse PLS discriminant analysis(sPLS-DA) make a L1 penal on the variable selection to remove the influnces from unrelated variables, which make sense for high-throughput omics data(Lê Cao, Boitard, and Besse 2011). For o-PLS-DA, s-plot could be used to find features.(Wiklund et al. 2008) 9.6 Self-organizing map 9.7 Canonical correlation analysis Find the correlationship between two datasets. 9.8 Software MetaboAnalystR caret could employ more than 200 statistical models in a general framework to build/select models. You could also show the variable importance for some of the models. References "],
["workflow-2.html", "Chapter 10 Workflow 10.1 Platform for metabolomics 10.2 Data sharing 10.3 Contest 10.4 Demo", " Chapter 10 Workflow 10.1 Platform for metabolomics Here is a list for related open source projects 10.1.1 XCMS online XCMS online is hosted by Scripps Institute. If your datasets are not large, XCMS online would be the best option for you. Recently they updated the online version to support more functions for systems biology. They use metlin and iso metlin to annotate the MS/MS data. Pathway analysis is also supported. Besides, to accelerate the process, xcms online employed stream (windows only). You could use stream to connect your instrument workstation to their server and process the data along with the data acquisition automate. They also developed apps for xcms online, but I think apps for slack would be even cooler to control the data processing. 10.1.2 PRIMe PRIMe is from RIKEN and UC Davis. They update their database frequently(Tsugawa et al. 2016). It supports mzML and major MS vendor formats. They defined own file format ABF and eco-system for omics studies. The software are updated almost everyday. You could use MS-DIAL for untargeted analysis and MRMOROBS for targeted analysis. For annotation, they developed MS-FINDER and statistic tools with excel. This platform could replaced the dear software from company and well prepared for MS/MS data analysis and lipidomics. They are open source, work on Windows and also could run within mathmamtics. However, they don’t cover pathway analysis. Another feature is they always show the most recently spectral records from public repositories. You could always get the updated MSP spectra files for your own data analysis. If you make GC-MS based metabolomics, this paper(Matsuo et al. 2017) could be nice start. 10.1.3 OpenMS OpenMS is another good platform for mass spectrum data analysis developed with C++. You could use them as plugin of KNIME. I suggest anyone who want to be a data scientist to get familiar with platform like KNIME because they supplied various API for different programme language, which is easy to use and show every steps for others. Also TOPPView in OpenMS could be the best software to visualize the MS data. You could always use the metabolomics workflow to train starter about details in data processing. pyOpenMS and OpenSWATH are also used in this platform. If you want to turn into industry, this platform fit you best because you might get a clear idea about solution and workflow. 10.1.4 MZmine 2 MZmine 2 has three version developed on Java platform and the lastest version is included into MSDK. Similar function could be found from MZmine 2 as shown in XCMS online. However, MZmine 2 do not have pathway analysis. You could use metaboanalyst for that purpose. Actually, you could go into MSDK to find similar function supplied by ProteoSuite and Openchrom. If you are a experienced coder for Java, you should start here. 10.1.5 XCMS xcms is different from xcms online while they might share the same code. I used it almost every data to run local metabolomics data analysis. Recently, they will change their version to xcms 3 with major update for object class. Their data format would integrate into the MSnbase package and the parameters would be easy to set up for each step. Normally, I will use msconvert-IPO-xcms-xMSannotator-metaboanalyst as workflow to process the offline data. It could accelerate the process by parallel processing. However, if you are not familiar with R, you would better to choose some software above. 10.1.6 Emory MaHPIC This platform is composed by several R packages from Emory University including apLCMS to collect the data, xMSanalyzer to handle automated pipeline for large-scale, non-targeted metabolomics data, xMSannotator for annotation of LC-MS data and Mummichog for pathway and network analysis for high-throughput metabolomics. This platform would be preferred by someone from environmental science to study exposome. I always use xMSannotator to annotate the LC-MS data. 10.1.7 DIA data analysis Skyline is a freely-available and open source Windows client application for building Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) / Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM), Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM - Targeted MS/MS), Data Independent Acquisition (DIA/SWATH) and targeted DDA with MS1 quantitative methods and analyzing the resulting mass spectrometer data. MSstats is an R-based/Bioconductor package for statistical relative quantification of peptides and proteins in mass spectrometry-based proteomic experiments. It is applicable to multiple types of sample preparation, including label-free workflows, workflows that use stable isotope labeled reference proteins and peptides, and work-flows that use fractionation. It is applicable to targeted Selected Reactin Monitoring(SRM), Data-Dependent Acquisiton(DDA or shotgun), and Data-Independent Acquisition(DIA or SWATH-MS). This github page is for sharing source and testing. MS-DAIL is also an option for DIA. 10.1.8 Others MAVEN from Princeton University MAIT based on xcms and you could find source code here(Fernández-Albert et al. 2014). metabolomics is a CRAN package for analysis of metabolomics data. LipidFinder A computational workflow for discovery of new lipid molecular species enviGCMS from environmental non-targeted analysis. pySM provides a reference implementation of our pipeline for False Discovery Rate-controlled metabolite annotation of high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry data. MetabolomeExpress a public place to process, interpret and share GC/MS metabolomics datasets. PhenoMeNal is an easy-to-use, cloud-based metabolomic research environment. MetAlign&amp;MSClust MetaboliteDetector is a QT4 based software package for the analysis of GC/MS based metabolomics data. 10.2 Data sharing See this paper(Haug, Salek, and Steinbeck 2017): MetaboLights EU based The Metabolomics Workbench US based MetabolomeXchange search engine W4M(Guitton et al. 2017) 10.3 Contest CASMI predict smail molecular contest 10.4 Demo References "],

Then assign a name for your project. I also recommend the following tips if you are familiar with it. Use git/github to make version control of your code and sync your project online. NOT use your name for your project because other peoples might cooperate with you and someone might check your data when you publish your papers. Each project should be a work for one paper or one chapter in your thesis. Use workflow document(txt or doc) in your project to record all of the steps and code you performed for this project. Treat this document as digital version of your experiment notebook Use data folder in your project folder for the raw data and the results you get in data analysis Use figure folder in your project folder for the figure Use munuscript folder in your project folder for the manuscript (you could write paper in rstudio with the help of template in Rmarkdown) Just double click [yourprojectname].Rproj to start your project 11.2 Data input xcms does not support all of the Raw files from every mass spectrometry manufacturers. You need to convert your Raw data into some open-source data format such as mzData, mzXML or CDF files. The tool is MScovert from ProteoWizard. 11.3 Optimization IPO package could be used to optimaze the parameters for XCMS.

In xcms, all of related staffs are handled by xcmsSet function. For any functions in xcms or R, you could get their documents by type ? before certain function. Another geek way is input the name of the function in the console of Rstudio and press F1 for help. ?xcmsSet In the document of xcmsset, we could set the sample classes, profmethod, profparam, polarity,etc. In the online version, such configurations are shown in certain windows. In the local analysis environment, such parameters are setup by yourselves. However, I think the default configurations could satisfied most of the analysis because related information should have been recorded in your Raw data and xcms could find them. All you need to do is that show the data dictionary for xcmsSet. If your data have many groups such as control and treated group, just put them in separate subfolder of the data folder and xcmsSet would read them as separated groups. 11.4.2 Data correction Reasons of data correction might come from many aspects such as the unstable instrument and pollution on column. In xcms, the most important correction is retention time correction. Remember the original retention time might changed and use another object to save the new object. 11.4.3 Peaks filling After the retention time correction, filling the missing peaks could be done by fillpeaks. Peaks filling could avoid two many NAs for false statistical analysis. The algorithm could use the baseline signal to impute the data. 11.5 Peaks list Then we could extract the peaks list from xcmsSet objects. library(enviGCMS) # get the xcmsset object neg &lt;- getrtmz(&#39;D:/metademo/data/&#39;) # back up the xcmsset object save(neg,file = &#39;neg.Rdata&#39;) # get the number npeaks &lt;- nrow(neg@groups) # get the EIC, boxplot and diffreport, eixmax should be equal to the numbers of peaks groups in the pos objects report &lt;- CAMERA::annotateDiffreport(neg,filebase = &#39;peaklistneg&#39;,metlin = T, eicmax = npeaks, classeic = neg@phenoData$class) # save the report as a csv file write.csv(report,file = &#39;all.csv&#39;) 11.6 Peaks filtering After we get the peaks list, it’s nessary to filter the peaks list to retain the peaks with high quality for further analysis. Normally, we could use the relative standard deviation of blank and pooled QC samples to control the peaks list. load(&#39;neg.Rdata&#39;) # get the peak intensity, m/z, retention time and group information as list mzrt &lt;- enviGCMS::getmzrt(neg) # get the mean and rsd for each group mzrtm &lt;- enviGCMS::getdoe(mzrt) gm &lt;- mzrtm$groupmean gr &lt;- mzrtm$grouprsd # find the blank group and pool QC group blk &lt;- grepl(&#39;k&#39;,colnames(gm)) pqc &lt;- grepl(&#39;q&#39;,colnames(gm)) # filter by pool QC and blank&#39;s group mean intensity(pool QC should larger than three times of blank), return numbers and index sum(indexmean &lt;- apply(gm,1,function(x) all(x[pqc]&gt;= 3*x[blk]))) # filt by pool qc rsd%, return numbers and index rsdcf &lt;- 30 sum(indexrsd &lt;- apply(gr,1,function(x) ifelse(is.na(x[pqc]),T,x[pqc]&lt;rsdcf))) # overlap with rsd% and mean filter sum(index &lt;- indexmean&amp;indexrsd) # new list, update group and remove pool qc/blk qcindex &lt;- grepl(&#39;k&#39;,mzrt$group$class) | grepl(&#39;q&#39;,mzrt$group$class) mzrtfilter &lt;- list(data = mzrt$data[index,!qcindex], mz = mzrt$mz[index], rt = mzrt$rt[index], group = droplevels(mzrt$group$class[!qcindex,drop =T])) # get the filtered csv enviGCMS::getupload(mzrtfilter,name = &#39;peakfilter&#39;) 11.7 Normalization (Optional) Normailizaiton is nesscery if you data are collected at different batch or runned in differen instrument parameters. # visulize the batch effect mzrtsim::rlaplot(mzrt$data,lv = mzrt$group$class) mzrtsim::ridgesplot(mzrt$data,lv = mzrt$group$class) # get the simulation data and test on NOREVA sim &lt;- mzrtsim::simmzrt(mzrt$data) mzrtsim::simdata(sim) # correct the batch effect by sva mzrtcor &lt;- mzrtsim::svacor(mzrt$data,lv = mzrt$group$class) # visulize the batch effect correction li &lt;- mzrtsim::limmaplot(mzrtcor,lv = mzrt$group$class) # return the corrected data mzrt$data &lt;- mzrtcor$dataCorrected 11.8 Statistic analysis Here we could use caret package to perform statistical analysis. library(caret) ## Spliting data trainIndex &lt;- createDataPartition(mzrtfilter$data, p = .8, list = FALSE, times = 1) ## Get the training and testing datasets Train &lt;- data[ trainIndex,] Test &lt;- data[-trainIndex,] ## Set the cross validation method fitControl &lt;- trainControl(## 10-fold CV method = &quot;repeatedcv&quot;, number = 10, ## repeated ten times repeats = 10) # extra papameters for GBM gbmGrid &lt;- expand.grid(interaction.depth = c(1, 5, 9), n.trees = (1:30)*50, shrinkage = 0.1, n.minobsinnode = 20) set.seed(825) gbmFit &lt;- train(mzrtfilter$group ~ ., data = training, method = &quot;gbm&quot;, trControl = fitControl, verbose = FALSE, ## Now specify the exact models ## to evaluate: tuneGrid = gbmGrid) # show the fitting process plot(gbmFit) # ANOVA analysis for model selection anova(fit1,fit2) # find the important variables Imp &lt;- varImp(fit) plot(Imp) 11.9 Annotation Here I use xMSannotator package to make annotation with HMDB as reference database. library(xMSannotator) num_nodes = 10 data(&quot;adduct_weights&quot;) negsub &lt;- getrtmz(&#39;D:/metademo/data/oq/&#39;) anno &lt;- xsetplus::fanno(negsub,outloc = &#39;D:/metademo/anno&#39;,mode = &#39;neg&#39;) 11.10 Pathway Analysis We could output the files for online pathway analysis with mummichog algorithm. # get the file xsetplus::mumdata(neg,lv = mzrt$group$class) # http://mummichog.org/index.html # mummichog1 -f &#39;test.txt&#39; -o myResult 11.11 MetaboAnalyst Actully, after you perform data correction, you have got the data matrix for statistic analysis.

["exposome.html", "Chapter 12 Exposome 12.1 Internal exposure 12.2 External exposure", " Chapter 12 Exposome According to CDC, The exposome can be defined as the measure of all the exposures of an individual in a lifetime and how those exposures relate to health. Exposomics is the study of the exposome and relies on the application of internal and external exposure assessment methods. Internal exposure relies on fields of study such as genomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. External exposure assessment relies on measuring environmental stressors. 12.1 Internal exposure HMDB is a freely available electronic database containing detailed information about small molecule metabolites found in the human body. Lipid Maps GMDB a multistage tandem mass spectral database using a variety of structurally defined glycans. KEGG is a collection of small molecules, biopolymers, and other chemical substances that are relevant to biological systems. Virtual Metabolic Human Database integrating human and gut microbiome metabolism with nutrition and disease. 12.2 External exposure 12.2.1 Environmental fate of compounds 12.2.1.1 QSPR Chemicalize is a powerful online platform for chemical calculations, search, and text processing. QSPR molecular descriptor generate tools list Spark uses computational algorithms based on fundamental chemical structure theory to estimate a wide variety of reactivity parameters strictly from molecular structure. LogP is important for analytical chemistry. Mannhold (Mannhold et al. 2009) report a comprehensive comparison of logP algorithms. Later, Rajarshi Guha make a comparison with logP algorithms with CDK based on logPstar dataset. Commercial software such as Spark, ACS Labs and ChemAxon might always claim a better performance on in-house dataset compared with public software like KowWIN within EPI Suite. However, we should be careful to evaluate the influnce of logP accuracy on the metabolites or unknown compounds. 12.2.1.2 Fate Wania Group developed software tools to address various aspects of organic contaminant fate and behaviour. Trent University release models to predict environmental fate for pollutions such as Level 3. EAWAG-BBD could provide information on microbial enzyme-catalyzed reactions that are important for biotechnology. 12.2.2 Exposure study database The information system PANGAEA is operated as an Open Access library aimed at archiving, publishing and distributing georeferenced data from earth system research. Environmental Health Criteria (EHC) Monographs CTD is a robust, publicly available database that aims to advance understanding about how environmental exposures affect human health. ODMOA facilitates and coordinates the collection, access to, and use of public health data in order to monitor and improve population health. This data is better for general public health research for Massachusetts. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program provides information on cancer statistics in an effort to reduce the cancer burden among the U.S. population.
