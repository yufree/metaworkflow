This is an online handout for mass spectrometry based metabolomics data analysis. It would cover a full reproducible metabolomics workflow for data analysis and important topics related to metabolomics. Here is a list of topics:

-   Sample collection
-   Sample pretreatment
-   Principles of metabolomics data analysis
-   Software selection
-   Batch correction
-   Annotation
-   Omics analysis
-   Exposome

This is a book written in **Bookdown**. You could contribute it by a pull request in Github. A workshop based on this book could be found [here](https://github.com/yufree/mdaw). Meanwhile, a docker image [xcmsrocker](https://hub.docker.com/r/yufree/xcmsrocker/) is available for metabolomics reproducible research.

[**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) and [**Rstudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/) are the software needed in this workflow.
