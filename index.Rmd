# Preface {-}

This is an online handout for data analysis in mass spectrometry based metabolomics. It would cover a full reproducible metabolomics workflow for data analysis and important topics related to metabolomics. Here is a list:

- Software selection
- Pretreatment
- Batch correction
- Annotation
- Omics analysis

This is a book written in **Bookdown**. You could contribute it by a pull request in Github.

[**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) and [**Rstudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/) are the softwares needed in this workflow.
